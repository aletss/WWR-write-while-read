Oh well, it was just a bad dream.\u2019 Going to the bathroom,\nhumanity washes its face, examines its wrinkles in the mirror, makes a cup of coffee and opens the\ndiary. \u2018Let\u2019s see what\u2019s on the agenda today.\u2019\nFor thousands of years the answer to this question remained unchanged. The same three problems\npreoccupied the people of twentieth-century China, of medieval India and of ancient Egypt. Famine,\nplague and war were always at the top of the list. For generation after generation humans have prayed\nto every god, angel and saint, and have invented countless tools, institutions and social systems \u2013 but\nthey continued to die in their millions from starvation, epidemics and violence. Many thinkers and\nprophets concluded that famine, plague and war must be an integral part of God\u2019s cosmic plan or of\nour imperfect nature, and nothing short of the end of time would free us from them.\nYet at the dawn of the third millennium, humanity wakes up to an amazing realisation. Most people\nrarely think about it, but in the last few decades we have managed to rein in famine, plague and war.\nOf course, these problems have not been completely solved, but they have been transformed from\nincomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. We don\u2019t need to\npray to any god or saint to rescue us from them. We know quite well what needs to be done in order to\nprevent famine, plague and war \u2013 and we usually succeed in doing it.\nTrue, there are still notable failures; but when faced with such failures we no longer shrug our\nshoulders and say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s the way things work in our imperfect world\u2019 or \u2018God\u2019s will be done\u2019.\nRather, when famine, plague or war break out of our control, we feel that somebody must have\nscrewed up, we set up a commission of inquiry, and promise ourselves that next time we\u2019ll do better.\nAnd it actually works. Such calamities indeed happen less and less often. For the first time in history,\nmore people die today from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age\nthan from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists\nand criminals combined. In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die\nfrom bingeing at McDonald\u2019s than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.\nHence even though presidents, CEOs and generals still have their daily schedules full of economic\ncrises and military conflicts, on the cosmic scale of history humankind can lift its eyes up and start\nlooking towards new horizons. If we are indeed bringing famine, plague and war under control, what\nwill replace them at the top of the human agenda? Like firefighters in a world without fire, so\nhumankind in the twenty-first century needs to ask itself an unprecedented question: what are we\ngoing to do with ourselves? In a healthy, prosperous and harmonious world, what will demand our\nattention and ingenuity? This question becomes doubly urgent given the immense new powers that\nbiotechnology and information technology are providing us with. What will we do with all that\npower?\nBefore answering this question, we need to say a few more words about famine, plague and war.\nThe claim that we are bringing them under control may strike many as outrageous, extremely na\u00efve, or\nperhaps callous. What about the billions of people scraping a living on less than $2 a day? What\nabout the ongoing AIDS crisis in Africa, or the wars raging in Syria and Iraq? To address these\nconcerns, let us take a closer look at the world of the early twenty-first century, before exploring the\nhuman agenda for the coming decades.\nThe Biological Poverty Line\nLet\u2019s start with famine, which for thousands of years has been humanity\u2019s worst enemy. Until recently\nmost humans lived on the very edge of the biological poverty line, below which people succumb to\nmalnutrition and hunger. A small mistake or a bit of bad luck could easily be a death sentence for an\nentire family or village. If heavy rains destroyed your wheat crop, or robbers carried off your goat\nherd, you and your loved ones may well have starved to death. Misfortune or stupidity on the\ncollective level resulted in mass famines. When severe drought hit ancient Egypt or medieval India, it\nwas not uncommon that 5 or 10 per cent of the population perished. Provisions became scarce;\ntransport was too slow and expensive to import sufficient food; and governments were far too weak\nto save the day.\nOpen any history book and you are likely to come across horrific accounts of famished populations,\ndriven mad by hunger. In April 1694 a French official in the town of Beauvais described the impact\nof famine and of soaring food prices, saying that his entire district was now filled with \u2018an infinite\nnumber of poor souls, weak from hunger and wretchedness and dying from want, because, having no\nwork or occupation, they lack the money to buy bread. Seeking to prolong their lives a little and\nsomewhat to appease their hunger, these poor folk eat such unclean things as cats and the flesh of\nhorses flayed and cast onto dung heaps. [Others consume] the blood that flows when cows and oxen\nare slaughtered, and the offal that cooks throw into the streets. Other poor wretches eat nettles and\nweeds, or roots and herbs which they boil in water.\u2019\n1\nSimilar scenes took place all over France. Bad weather had ruined the harvests throughout the\nkingdom in the previous two years, so that by the spring of 1694 the granaries were completely empty.\nThe rich charged exorbitant prices for whatever food they managed to hoard, and the poor died in\ndroves. About 2.8 million French \u2013 15 per cent of the population \u2013 starved to death between 1692 and\n1694, while the Sun King, Louis XIV, was dallying with his mistresses in Versailles. The following\nyear, 1695, famine struck Estonia, killing a fifth of the population. In 1696 it was the turn of Finland,\nwhere a quarter to a third of people died. Scotland suffered from severe famine between 1695 and\n1698, some districts losing up to 20 per cent of their inhabitants.\n2\nMost readers probably know how it feels when you miss lunch, when you fast on some religious\nholiday, or when you live for a few days on vegetable shakes as part of a new wonder diet. But how\ndoes it feel when you haven\u2019t eaten for days on end and you have no clue where to get the next morsel\nof food? Most people today have never experienced this excruciating torment. Our ancestors, alas,\nknew it only too well. When they cried to God, \u2018Deliver us from famine!\u2019, this is what they had in\nmind.\nDuring the last hundred years, technological, economic and political developments have created an\nincreasingly robust safety net separating humankind from the biological poverty line. Mass famines\nstill strike some areas from time to time, but they are exceptional, and they are almost always caused\nby human politics rather than by natural catastrophes. In most parts of the planet, even if a person has\nlost his job and all of his possessions, he is unlikely to die from hunger. Private insurance schemes,\ngovernment agencies and international NGOs may not rescue him from poverty, but they will provide\nhim with enough daily calories to survive. On the collective level, the global trade network turns\ndroughts and floods into business opportunities, and makes it possible to overcome food shortages\nquickly and cheaply. Even when wars, earthquakes or tsunamis devastate entire countries,\ninternational efforts usually succeed in preventing famine. Though hundreds of millions still go hungry\nalmost every day, in most countries very few people actually starve to death.\nPoverty certainly causes many other health problems, and malnutrition shortens life expectancy\neven in the richest countries on earth. In France, for example, 6 million people (about 10 per cent of\nthe population) suffer from nutritional insecurity. They wake up in the morning not knowing whether\nthey will have anything to eat for lunch; they often go to sleep hungry; and the nutrition they do obtain\nis unbalanced and unhealthy \u2013 lots of starch, sugar and salt, and not enough protein and vitamins.\n3 Yet\nnutritional insecurity isn\u2019t famine, and France of the early twenty-first century isn\u2019t France of 1694.\nEven in the worst slums around Beauvais or Paris, people don\u2019t die because they have not eaten for\nweeks on end.\nThe same transformation has occurred in numerous other countries, most notably China. For\nmillennia, famine stalked every Chinese regime from the Yellow Emperor to the Red communists. A\nfew decades ago China was a byword for food shortages. Tens of millions of Chinese starved to\ndeath during the disastrous Great Leap Forward, and experts routinely predicted that the problem\nwould only get worse. In 1974 the first World Food Conference was convened in Rome, and\ndelegates were treated to apocalyptic scenarios. They were told that there was no way for China to\nfeed its billion people, and that the world\u2019s most populous country was heading towards catastrophe.\nIn fact, it was heading towards the greatest economic miracle in history. Since 1974 hundreds of\nmillions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty, and though hundreds of millions more still suffer\ngreatly from privation and malnutrition, for the first time in its recorded history China is now free\nfrom famine.\nIndeed, in most countries today overeating has become a far worse problem than famine. In the\neighteenth century Marie Antoinette allegedly advised the starving masses that if they ran out of\nbread, they should just eat cake instead. Today, the poor are following this advice to the letter.\nWhereas the rich residents of Beverly Hills eat lettuce salad and steamed tofu with quinoa, in the\nslums and ghettos the poor gorge on Twinkie cakes, Cheetos, hamburgers and pizza. In 2014 more\nthan 2.1 billion people were overweight, compared to 850 million who suffered from malnutrition.\nHalf of humankind is expected to be overweight by 2030.\n4\nIn 2010 famine and malnutrition combined\nkilled about 1 million people, whereas obesity killed 3 million.\n5\nInvisible Armadas\nAfter famine, humanity\u2019s second great enemy was plagues and infectious diseases. Bustling cities\nlinked by a ceaseless stream of merchants, officials and pilgrims were both the bedrock of human\ncivilisation and an ideal breeding ground for pathogens. People consequently lived their lives in\nancient Athens or medieval Florence knowing that they might fall ill and die next week, or that an\nepidemic might suddenly erupt and destroy their entire family in one swoop.\nThe most famous such outbreak, the so-called Black Death, began in the 1330s, somewhere in east\nor central Asia, when the flea-dwelling bacterium Yersinia pestis started infecting humans bitten by\nthe fleas. From there, riding on an army of rats and fleas, the plague quickly spread all over Asia,\nEurope and North Africa, taking less than twenty years to reach the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.\nBetween 75 million and 200 million people died \u2013 more than a quarter of the population of Eurasia.\nIn England, four out of ten people died, and the population dropped from a pre-plague high of 3.7\nmillion people to a post-plague low of 2.2 million. The city of Florence lost 50,000 of its 100,000\ninhabitants.\n6\nMedieval people personified the Black Death as a horrific demonic force beyond human control or comprehension.\nThe Triumph of Death, c.1562, Bruegel, Pieter the Elder \u00a9 The Art Archive/Alamy Stock Photo.\nThe authorities were completely helpless in the face of the calamity. Except for organising mass\nprayers and processions, they had no idea how to stop the spread of the epidemic \u2013 let alone cure it.\nUntil the modern era, humans blamed diseases on bad air, malicious demons and angry gods, and did\nnot suspect the existence of bacteria and viruses. People readily believed in angels and fairies, but\nthey could not imagine that a tiny flea or a single drop of water might contain an entire armada of\ndeadly predators.\nThe real culprit was the minuscule Yersinia pestis bacterium.\n\u00a9 NIAID/CDC/Science Photo Library.\nThe Black Death was not a singular event, nor even the worst plague in history. More disastrous\nepidemics struck America, Australia and the Pacific Islands following the arrival of the first\nEuropeans. Unbeknown to the explorers and settlers, they brought with them new infectious diseases\nagainst which the natives had no immunity. Up to 90 per cent of the local populations died as a\nresult.\n7\nOn 5 March 1520 a small Spanish flotilla left the island of Cuba on its way to Mexico. The ships\ncarried 900 Spanish soldiers along with horses, firearms and a few African slaves. One of the slaves,\nFrancisco de Egu\u00eda, carried on his person a far deadlier cargo. Francisco didn\u2019t know it, but\nsomewhere among his trillions of cells a biological time bomb was ticking: the smallpox virus. After\nFrancisco landed in Mexico the virus began to multiply exponentially within his body, eventually\nbursting out all over his skin in a terrible rash. The feverish Francisco was taken to bed in the house\nof a Native American family in the town of Cempoallan. He infected the family members, who\ninfected the neighbours. Within ten days Cempoallan became a graveyard. Refugees spread the\ndisease from Cempoallan to the nearby towns. As town after town succumbed to the plague, new\nwaves of terrified refugees carried the disease throughout Mexico and beyond.\nThe Mayas in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula believed that three evil gods \u2013 Ekpetz, Uzannkak and Sojakak\n\u2013 were flying from village to village at night, infecting people with the disease. The Aztecs blamed it\non the gods Tezcatlipoca and Xipe, or perhaps on the black magic of the white people. Priests and\ndoctors were consulted. They advised prayers, cold baths, rubbing the body with bitumen and\nsmearing squashed black beetles on the sores. Nothing helped. Tens of thousands of corpses lay\nrotting in the streets, without anyone daring to approach and bury them. Entire families perished\nwithin a few days, and the authorities ordered that the houses were to be collapsed on top of the\nbodies. In some settlements half the population died.\nIn September 1520 the plague had reached the Valley of Mexico, and in October it entered the gates\nof the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan \u2013 a magnificent metropolis of 250,000 people. Within two months at\nleast a third of the population perished, including the Aztec emperor Cuitl\u00e1huac. Whereas in March\n1520, when the Spanish fleet arrived, Mexico was home to 22 million people, by December only 14\nmillion were still alive. Smallpox was only the first blow. While the new Spanish masters were busy\nenriching themselves and exploiting the natives, deadly waves of flu, measles and other infectious\ndiseases struck Mexico one after the other, until in 1580 its population was down to less than 2\nmillion.\n8\nTwo centuries later, on 18 January 1778, the British explorer Captain James Cook reached Hawaii.\nThe Hawaiian islands were densely populated by half a million people, who lived in complete\nisolation from both Europe and America, and consequently had never been exposed to European and\nAmerican diseases. Captain Cook and his men introduced the first flu, tuberculosis and syphilis\npathogens to Hawaii. Subsequent European visitors added typhoid and smallpox. By 1853, only\n70,000 survivors remained in Hawaii.\n9\nEpidemics continued to kill tens of millions of people well into the twentieth century. In January\n1918 soldiers in the trenches of northern France began dying in their thousands from a particularly\nvirulent strain of flu, nicknamed \u2018the Spanish Flu\u2019. The front line was the end point of the most\nefficient global supply network the world had hitherto seen. Men and munitions were pouring in from\nBritain, the USA, India and Australia. Oil was sent from the Middle East, grain and beef from\nArgentina, rubber from Malaya and copper from Congo. In exchange, they all got Spanish Flu. Within\na few months, about half a billion people \u2013 a third of the global population \u2013 came down with the\nvirus. In India it killed 5 per cent of the population (15 million people). On the island of Tahiti, 14\nper cent died. On Samoa, 20 per cent. In the copper mines of the Congo one out of five labourers\nperished. Altogether the pandemic killed between 50 million and 100 million people in less than a\nyear. The First World War killed 40 million from 1914 to 1918.\n10\nAlongside such epidemical tsunamis that struck humankind every few decades, people also faced\nsmaller but more regular waves of infectious diseases, which killed millions every year. Children\nwho lacked immunity were particularly susceptible to them, hence they are often called \u2018childhood\ndiseases\u2019. Until the early twentieth century, about a third of children died before reaching adulthood\nfrom a combination of malnutrition and disease.\nDuring the last century humankind became ever more vulnerable to epidemics, due to a\ncombination of growing populations and better transport. A modern metropolis such as Tokyo or\nKinshasa offers pathogens far richer hunting grounds than medieval Florence or 1520 Tenochtitlan,\nand the global transport network is today even more efficient than in 1918. A Spanish virus can make\nits way to Congo or Tahiti in less than twenty-four hours. We should therefore have expected to live in\nan epidemiological hell, with one deadly plague after another.\nHowever, both the incidence and impact of epidemics have gone down dramatically in the last few\ndecades. In particular, global child mortality is at an all-time low: less than 5 per cent of children die\nbefore reaching adulthood. In the developed world the rate is less than 1 per cent.\n11 This miracle is\ndue to the unprecedented achievements of twentieth-century medicine, which has provided us with\nvaccinations, antibiotics, improved hygiene and a much better medical infrastructure.\nFor example, a global campaign of smallpox vaccination was so successful that in 1979 the World\nHealth Organization declared that humanity had won, and that smallpox had been completely\neradicated. It was the first epidemic humans had ever managed to wipe off the face of the earth. In\n1967 smallpox had still infected 15 million people and killed 2 million of them, but in 2014 not a\nsingle person was either infected or killed by smallpox. The victory has been so complete that today\nthe WHO has stopped vaccinating humans against smallpox.\n12\nEvery few years we are alarmed by the outbreak of some potential new plague, such as SARS in\n2002/3, bird flu in 2005, swine flu in 2009/10 and Ebola in 2014. Yet thanks to efficient counter-\nmeasures these incidents have so far resulted in a comparatively small number of victims. SARS, for\nexample, initially raised fears of a new Black Death, but eventually ended with the death of less than\n1,000 people worldwide.\n13 The Ebola outbreak in West Africa seemed at first to spiral out of control,\nand on 26 September 2014 the WHO described it as \u2018the most severe public health emergency seen in\nmodern times\u2019.\n14 Nevertheless, by early 2015 the epidemic had been reined in, and in January 2016\nthe WHO declared it over. It infected 30,000 people (killing 11,000 of them), caused massive\neconomic damage throughout West Africa, and sent shockwaves of anxiety across the world; but it did\nnot spread beyond West Africa, and its death toll was nowhere near the scale of the Spanish Flu or\nthe Mexican smallpox epidemic.\nEven the tragedy of AIDS, seemingly the greatest medical failure of the last few decades, can be\nseen as a sign of progress. Since its first major outbreak in the early 1980s, more than 30 million\npeople have died of AIDS, and tens of millions more have suffered debilitating physical and\npsychological damage. It was hard to understand and treat the new epidemic, because AIDS is a\nuniquely devious disease. Whereas a human infected with the smallpox virus dies within a few days,\nan HIV-positive patient may seem perfectly healthy for weeks and months, yet go on infecting others\nunknowingly. In addition, the HIV virus itself does not kill. Rather, it destroys the immune system,\nthereby exposing the patient to numerous other diseases. It is these secondary diseases that actually\nkill AIDS victims. Consequently, when AIDS began to spread, it was especially difficult to\nunderstand what was happening. When two patients were admitted to a New York hospital in 1981,\none ostensibly dying from pneumonia and the other from cancer, it was not at all evident that both\nwere in fact victims of the HIV virus, which may have infected them months or even years\npreviously.\n15\nHowever, despite these difficulties, after the medical community became aware of the mysterious\nnew plague, it took scientists just two years to identify it, understand how the virus spreads and\nsuggest effective ways to slow down the epidemic. Within another ten years new medicines turned\nAIDS from a death sentence into a chronic condition (at least for those wealthy enough to afford the\ntreatment).\n16 Just think what would have happened if AIDS had erupted in 1581 rather than 1981. In\nall likelihood, nobody back then would have figured out what caused the epidemic, how it moved\nfrom person to person, or how it could be halted (let alone cured). Under such conditions, AIDS\nmight have killed a much larger proportion of the human race, equalling and perhaps even surpassing\nthe Black Death.\nDespite the horrendous toll AIDS has taken, and despite the millions killed each year by longestablished infectious diseases such as malaria, epidemics are a far smaller threat to human health\ntoday than in previous millennia. The vast majority of people die from non-infectious illnesses such\nas cancer and heart disease, or simply from old age.\n17\n(Incidentally cancer and heart disease are of\ncourse not new illnesses \u2013 they go back to antiquity. In previous eras, however, relatively few people\nlived long enough to die from them.)\nMany fear that this is only a temporary victory, and that some unknown cousin of the Black Death is\nwaiting just around the corner. No one can guarantee that plagues won\u2019t make a comeback, but there\nare good reasons to think that in the arms race between doctors and germs, doctors run faster. New\ninfectious diseases appear mainly as a result of chance mutations in pathogen genomes. These\nmutations allow the pathogens to jump from animals to humans, to overcome the human immune\nsystem, or to resist medicines such as antibiotics. Today such mutations probably occur and\ndisseminate faster than in the past, due to human impact on the environment.\n18 Yet in the race against\nmedicine, pathogens ultimately depend on the blind hand of fortune.\nDoctors, in contrast, count on more than mere luck. Though science owes a huge debt to\nserendipity, doctors don\u2019t just throw different chemicals into test tubes, hoping to chance upon some\nnew medicine. With each passing year doctors accumulate more and better knowledge, which they use\nin order to design more effective medicines and treatments. Consequently, though in 2050 we will\nundoubtedly face much more resilient germs, medicine in 2050 will likely be able to deal with them\nmore efficiently than today.\n19\nIn 2015 doctors announced the discovery of a completely new type of antibiotic \u2013 teixobactin \u2013 to\nwhich bacteria have no resistance as yet. Some scholars believe teixobactin may prove to be a gamechanger in the fight against highly resistant germs.\n20 Scientists are also developing revolutionary new\ntreatments that work in radically different ways to any previous medicine. For example, some\nresearch labs are already home to nano-robots, that may one day navigate through our bloodstream,\nidentify illnesses and kill pathogens and cancerous cells.\n21 Microorganisms may have 4 billion years\nof cumulative experience fighting organic enemies, but they have exactly zero experience fighting\nbionic predators, and would therefore find it doubly difficult to evolve effective defences.\nSo while we cannot be certain that some new Ebola outbreak or an unknown flu strain won\u2019t sweep\nacross the globe and kill millions, we will not regard it as an inevitable natural calamity. Rather, we\nwill see it as an inexcusable human failure and demand the heads of those responsible. When in late\nsummer 2014 it seemed for a few terrifying weeks that Ebola was gaining the upper hand over the\nglobal health authorities, investigative committees were hastily set up. An initial report published on\n18 October 2014 criticised the World Health Organization for its unsatisfactory reaction to the\noutbreak, blaming the epidemic on corruption and inefficiency in the WHO\u2019s African branch. Further\ncriticism was levelled at the international community as a whole for not responding quickly and\nforcefully enough. Such criticism assumes that humankind has the knowledge and tools to prevent\nplagues, and if an epidemic nevertheless gets out of control, it is due to human incompetence rather\nthan divine anger.\nSo in the struggle against natural calamities such as AIDS and Ebola, the scales are tipping in\nhumanity\u2019s favour. But what about the dangers inherent in human nature itself? Biotechnology enables\nus to defeat bacteria and viruses, but it simultaneously turns humans themselves into an unprecedented\nthreat. The same tools that enable doctors to quickly identify and cure new illnesses may also enable\narmies and terrorists to engineer even more terrible diseases and doomsday pathogens. It is therefore\nlikely that major epidemics will continue to endanger humankind in the future only if humankind itself\ncreates them, in the service of some ruthless ideology. The era when humankind stood helpless before\nnatural epidemics is probably over. But we may come to miss it.\nBreaking the Law of the Jungle\nThe third piece of good news is that wars too are disappearing. Throughout history most humans took\nwar for granted, whereas peace was a temporary and precarious state. International relations were\ngoverned by the Law of the Jungle, according to which even if two polities lived in peace, war\nalways remained an option. For example, even though Germany and France were at peace in 1913,\neverybody knew that they might be at each other\u2019s throats in 1914. Whenever politicians, generals,\nbusiness people and ordinary citizens made plans for the future, they always left room for war. From\nthe Stone Age to the age of steam, and from the Arctic to the Sahara, every person on earth knew that\nat any moment the neighbours might invade their territory, defeat their army, slaughter their people and\noccupy their land.\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century this Law of the Jungle has finally been broken, if not\nrescinded. In most areas wars became rarer than ever. Whereas in ancient agricultural societies\nhuman violence caused about 15 per cent of all deaths, during the twentieth century violence caused\nonly 5 per cent of deaths, and in the early twenty-first century it is responsible for about 1 per cent of\nglobal mortality.\n22\nIn 2012 about 56 million people died throughout the world; 620,000 of them died\ndue to human violence (war killed 120,000 people, and crime killed another 500,000). In contrast,\n800,000 committed suicide, and 1.5 million died of diabetes.\n23 Sugar is now more dangerous than\ngunpowder.\nEven more importantly, a growing segment of humankind has come to see war as simply\ninconceivable. For the first time in history, when governments, corporations and private individuals\nconsider their immediate future, many of them don\u2019t think about war as a likely event. Nuclear\nweapons have turned war between superpowers into a mad act of collective suicide, and therefore\nforced the most powerful nations on earth to find alternative and peaceful ways to resolve conflicts.\nSimultaneously, the global economy has been transformed from a material-based economy into a\nknowledge-based economy. Previously the main sources of wealth were material assets such as gold\nmines, wheat fields and oil wells. Today the main source of wealth is knowledge. And whereas you\ncan conquer oil fields through war, you cannot acquire knowledge that way. Hence as knowledge\nbecame the most important economic resource, the profitability of war declined and wars became\nincreasingly restricted to those parts of the world \u2013 such as the Middle East and Central Africa \u2013\nwhere the economies are still old-fashioned material-based economies.\nIn 1998 it made sense for Rwanda to seize and loot the rich coltan mines of neighbouring Congo,\nbecause this ore was in high demand for the manufacture of mobile phones and laptops, and Congo\nheld 80 per cent of the world\u2019s coltan reserves. Rwanda earned $240 million annually from the\nlooted coltan. For poor Rwanda that was a lot of money.\n24\nIn contrast, it would have made no sense\nfor China to invade California and seize Silicon Valley, for even if the Chinese could somehow\nprevail on the battlefield, there were no silicon mines to loot in Silicon Valley. Instead, the Chinese\nhave earned billions of dollars from cooperating with hi-tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft,\nbuying their software and manufacturing their products. What Rwanda earned from an entire year of\nlooting Congolese coltan, the Chinese earn in a single day of peaceful commerce.\nIn consequence, the word \u2018peace\u2019 has acquired a new meaning. Previous generations thought about\npeace as the temporary absence of war. Today we think about peace as the implausibility of war.\nWhen in 1913 people said that there was peace between France and Germany, they meant that \u2018there\nis no war going on at present between France and Germany, but who knows what next year will\nbring\u2019. When today we say that there is peace between France and Germany, we mean that it is\ninconceivable under any foreseeable circumstances that war might break out between them. Such\npeace prevails not only between France and Germany, but between most (though not all) countries.\nThere is no scenario for a serious war breaking out next year between Germany and Poland, between\nIndonesia and the Philippines, or between Brazil and Uruguay.\nThis New Peace is not just a hippie fantasy. Power-hungry governments and greedy corporations\nalso count on it. When Mercedes plans its sales strategy in eastern Europe, it discounts the possibility\nthat Germany might conquer Poland. A corporation importing cheap labourers from the Philippines is\nnot worried that Indonesia might invade the Philippines next year. When the Brazilian government\nconvenes to discuss next year\u2019s budget, it\u2019s unimaginable that the Brazilian defence minister will rise\nfrom his seat, bang his fist on the table and shout, \u2018Just a minute! What if we want to invade and\nconquer Uruguay? You didn\u2019t take that into account. We have to put aside $5 billion to finance this\nconquest.\u2019 Of course, there are a few places where defence ministers still say such things, and there\nare regions where the New Peace has failed to take root. I know this very well because I live in one\nof these regions. But these are exceptions.\nThere is no guarantee, of course, that the New Peace will hold indefinitely. Just as nuclear\nweapons made the New Peace possible in the first place, so future technological developments might\nset the stage for new kinds of war. In particular, cyber warfare may destabilise the world by giving\neven small countries and non-state actors the ability to fight superpowers effectively. When the USA\nfought Iraq in 2003 it brought havoc to Baghdad and Mosul, but not a single bomb was dropped on\nLos Angeles or Chicago. In the future, though, a country such as North Korea or Iran could use logic\nbombs to shut down the power in California, blow up refineries in Texas and cause trains to collide\nin Michigan (\u2018logic bombs\u2019 are malicious software codes planted in peacetime and operated at a\ndistance. It is highly likely that networks controlling vital infrastructure facilities in the USA and\nmany other countries are already crammed with such codes).\nHowever, we should not confuse ability with motivation. Though cyber warfare introduces new\nmeans of destruction, it doesn\u2019t necessarily add new incentives to use them. Over the last seventy\nyears humankind has broken not only the Law of the Jungle, but also the Chekhov Law. Anton\nChekhov famously said that a gun appearing in the first act of a play will inevitably be fired in the\nthird. Throughout history, if kings and emperors acquired some new weapon, sooner or later they\nwere tempted to use it. Since 1945, however, humankind has learned to resist this temptation. The gun\nthat appeared in the first act of the Cold War was never fired. By now we are accustomed to living in\na world full of undropped bombs and unlaunched missiles, and have become experts in breaking both\nthe Law of the Jungle and the Chekhov Law. If these laws ever do catch up with us, it will be our own\nfault \u2013 not our inescapable destiny.\nNuclear missiles on parade in Moscow. The gun that was always on display but never fired.\nMoscow, 1968 \u00a9 Sovfoto/UIG via Getty Images.\nWhat about terrorism, then? Even if central governments and powerful states have learned restraint,\nterrorists might have no such qualms about using new and destructive weapons. That is certainly a\nworrying possibility. However, terrorism is a strategy of weakness adopted by those who lack access\nto real power. At least in the past, terrorism worked by spreading fear rather than by causing\nsignificant material damage. Terrorists usually don\u2019t have the strength to defeat an army, occupy a\ncountry or destroy entire cities. Whereas in 2010 obesity and related illnesses killed about 3 million\npeople, terrorists killed a total of 7,697 people across the globe, most of them in developing\ncountries.\n25 For the average American or European, Coca-Cola poses a far deadlier threat than alQaeda.\nHow, then, do terrorists manage to dominate the headlines and change the political situation\nthroughout the world? By provoking their enemies to overreact. In essence, terrorism is a show.\nTerrorists stage a terrifying spectacle of violence that captures our imagination and makes us feel as if\nwe are sliding back into medieval chaos. Consequently states often feel obliged to react to the theatre\nof terrorism with a show of security, orchestrating immense displays of force, such as the persecution\nof entire populations or the invasion of foreign countries. In most cases, this overreaction to terrorism\nposes a far greater threat to our security than the terrorists themselves.\nTerrorists are like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so weak that it cannot budge\neven a single teacup. So it finds a bull, gets inside its ear and starts buzzing. The bull goes wild with\nfear and anger, and destroys the china shop. This is what happened in the Middle East in the last\ndecade. Islamic fundamentalists could never have toppled Saddam Hussein by themselves. Instead\nthey enraged the USA by the 9/11 attacks, and the USA destroyed the Middle Eastern china shop for\nthem. Now they flourish in the wreckage. By themselves, terrorists are too weak to drag us back to the\nMiddle Ages and re-establish the Jungle Law. They may provoke us, but in the end, it all depends on\nour reactions. If the Jungle Law comes back into force, it will not be the fault of terrorists.\nFamine, plague and war will probably continue to claim millions of victims in the coming decades.\nYet they are no longer unavoidable tragedies beyond the understanding and control of a helpless\nhumanity. Instead, they have become manageable challenges. This does not belittle the suffering of\nhundreds of millions of poverty-stricken humans; of the millions felled each year by malaria, AIDS\nand tuberculosis; or of the millions trapped in violent vicious circles in Syria, the Congo or\nAfghanistan. The message is not that famine, plague and war have completely disappeared from the\nface of the earth, and that we should stop worrying about them. Just the opposite. Throughout history\npeople felt these were unsolvable problems, so there was no point trying to put an end to them.\nPeople prayed to God for miracles, but they themselves did not seriously attempt to exterminate\nfamine, plague and war. Those arguing that the world of 2016 is as hungry, sick and violent as it was\nin 1916 perpetuate this age-old defeatist view. They imply that all the huge efforts humans have made\nduring the twentieth century have achieved nothing, and that medical research, economic reforms and\npeace initiatives have all been in vain. If so, what is the point of investing our time and resources in\nfurther medical research, novel economic reforms or new peace initiatives?\nAcknowledging our past achievements sends a message of hope and responsibility, encouraging us\nto make even greater efforts in the future. Given our twentieth-century accomplishments, if people\ncontinue to suffer from famine, plague and war, we cannot blame it on nature or on God. It is within\nour power to make things better and to reduce the incidence of suffering even further.\nYet appreciating the magnitude of our achievements carries another message: history does not\ntolerate a vacuum. If incidences of famine, plague and war are decreasing, something is bound to take\ntheir place on the human agenda. We had better think very carefully what it is going to be. Otherwise,\nwe might gain complete victory in the old battlefields only to be caught completely unaware on\nentirely new fronts. What are the projects that will replace famine, plague and war at the top of the\nhuman agenda in the twenty-first century?\nOne central project will be to protect humankind and the planet as a whole from the dangers\ninherent in our own power. We have managed to bring famine, plague and war under control thanks\nlargely to our phenomenal economic growth, which provides us with abundant food, medicine, energy\nand raw materials. Yet this same growth destabilises the ecological equilibrium of the planet in\nmyriad ways, which we have only begun to explore. Humankind has been late in acknowledging this\ndanger, and has so far done very little about it. Despite all the talk of pollution, global warming and\nclimate change, most countries have yet to make any serious economic or political sacrifices to\nimprove the situation. When the moment comes to choose between economic growth and ecological\nstability, politicians, CEOs and voters almost always prefer growth. In the twenty-first century, we\nshall have to do better if we are to avoid catastrophe.\nWhat else will humanity strive for? Would we be content merely to count our blessings, keep\nfamine, plague and war at bay, and protect the ecological equilibrium? That might indeed be the\nwisest course of action, but humankind is unlikely to follow it. Humans are rarely satisfied with what\nthey already have. The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction,\nbut craving for more. Humans are always on the lookout for something better, bigger, tastier. When\nhumankind possesses enormous new powers, and when the threat of famine, plague and war is finally\nlifted, what will we do with ourselves? What will the scientists, investors, bankers and presidents do\nall day? Write poetry?\nSuccess breeds ambition, and our recent achievements are now pushing humankind to set itself\neven more daring goals. Having secured unprecedented levels of prosperity, health and harmony, and\ngiven our past record and our current values, humanity\u2019s next targets are likely to be immortality,\nhappiness and divinity. Having reduced mortality from starvation, disease and violence, we will now\naim to overcome old age and even death itself. Having saved people from abject misery, we will now\naim to make them positively happy. And having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival\nstruggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods, and turn Homo sapiens into Homo deus.\nThe Last Days of Death\nIn the twenty-first century humans are likely to make a serious bid for immortality. Struggling against\nold age and death will merely carry on the time-honoured fight against famine and disease, and\nmanifest the supreme value of contemporary culture: the worth of human life. We are constantly\nreminded that human life is the most sacred thing in the universe. Everybody says this: teachers in\nschools, politicians in parliaments, lawyers in courts and actors on theatre stages. The Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights adopted by the UN after the Second World War \u2013 which is perhaps the\nclosest thing we have to a global constitution \u2013 categorically states that \u2018the right to life\u2019 is humanity\u2019s\nmost fundamental value. Since death clearly violates this right, death is a crime against humanity, and\nwe ought to wage total war against it.\nThroughout history, religions and ideologies did not sanctify life itself. They always sanctified\nsomething above or beyond earthly existence, and were consequently quite tolerant of death. Indeed,\nsome of them have been downright fond of the Grim Reaper. Because Christianity, Islam and\nHinduism insisted that the meaning of our existence depended on our fate in the afterlife, they viewed\ndeath as a vital and positive part of the world. Humans died because God decreed it, and their\nmoment of death was a sacred metaphysical experience exploding with meaning. When a human was\nabout to breathe his last, this was the time to call priests, rabbis and shamans, to draw out the balance\nof life, and to embrace one\u2019s true role in the universe. Just try to imagine Christianity, Islam or\nHinduism in a world without death \u2013 which is also a world without heaven, hell or reincarnation.\nModern science and modern culture have an entirely different take on life and death. They don\u2019t\nthink of death as a metaphysical mystery, and they certainly don\u2019t view death as the source of life\u2019s\nmeaning. Rather, for modern people death is a technical problem that we can and should solve.\nHow exactly do humans die? Medieval fairy tales depicted Death as a figure in a hooded black\ncloak, his hand gripping a large scythe. A man lives his life, worrying about this and that, running here\nand there, when suddenly the Grim Reaper appears before him, taps him on the shoulder with a bony\nfinger and says, \u2018Come!\u2019 And the man implores: \u2018No, please! Wait just a year, a month, a day!\u2019 But the\nhooded figure hisses: \u2018No! You must come NOW!\u2019 And this is how we die.\nIn reality, however, humans don\u2019t die because a figure in a black cloak taps them on the shoulder,\nor because God decreed it, or because mortality is an essential part of some great cosmic plan.\nHumans always die due to some technical glitch. The heart stops pumping blood. The main artery is\nclogged by fatty deposits. Cancerous cells spread in the liver. Germs multiply in the lungs. And what\nis responsible for all these technical problems? Other technical problems. The heart stops pumping\nblood because not enough oxygen reaches the heart muscle. Cancerous cells spread because a chance\ngenetic mutation rewrote their instructions. Germs settled in my lungs because somebody sneezed on\nthe subway. Nothing metaphysical about it. It is all technical problems.\nDeath personified as the Grim Reaper in medieval art.\n\u2018Death and dying\u2019 from 14th-century French manuscript: Pilgrimage of the Human Life, Bodleian Library, Oxford \u00a9 Art Media/Print\nCollector/Getty Images.\nAnd every technical problem has a technical solution. We don\u2019t need to wait for the Second\nComing in order to overcome death. A couple of geeks in a lab can do it. If traditionally death was the\nspeciality of priests and theologians, now the engineers are taking over. We can kill the cancerous\ncells with chemotherapy or nano-robots. We can exterminate the germs in the lungs with antibiotics. If\nthe heart stops pumping, we can reinvigorate it with medicines and electric shocks \u2013 and if that\ndoesn\u2019t work, we can implant a new heart. True, at present we don\u2019t have solutions to all technical\nproblems. But this is precisely why we invest so much time and money in researching cancer, germs,\ngenetics and nanotechnology.\nEven ordinary people, who are not engaged in scientific research, have become used to thinking\nabout death as a technical problem. When a woman goes to her physician and asks, \u2018Doctor, what\u2019s\nwrong with me?\u2019 the doctor is likely to say, \u2018Well, you have the flu,\u2019 or \u2018You have tuberculosis,\u2019 or\n\u2018You have cancer.\u2019 But the doctor will never say, \u2018You have death.\u2019 And we are all under the\nimpression that flu, tuberculosis and cancer are technical problems, to which we might someday find\na technical solution.\nEven when people die in a hurricane, a car accident or a war, we tend to view it as a technical\nfailure that could and should have been prevented. If the government had only adopted a better policy;\nif the municipality had done its job properly; and if the military commander had taken a wiser\ndecision, death would have been avoided. Death has become an almost automatic reason for lawsuits\nand investigations. \u2018How could they have died? Somebody somewhere must have screwed up.\u2019\nThe vast majority of scientists, doctors and scholars still distance themselves from outright dreams\nof immortality, claiming that they are trying to overcome only this or that particular problem. Yet\nbecause old age and death are the outcome of nothing but particular problems, there is no point at\nwhich doctors and scientists are going to stop and declare: \u2018Thus far, and not another step. We have\novercome tuberculosis and cancer, but we won\u2019t lift a finger to fight Alzheimer\u2019s. People can go on\ndying from that.\u2019 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not say that humans have \u2018the right\nto life until the age of ninety\u2019. It says that every human has a right to life, period. That right isn\u2019t\nlimited by any expiry date.\nAn increasing minority of scientists and thinkers consequently speak more openly these days, and\nstate that the flagship enterprise of modern science is to defeat death and grant humans eternal youth.\nNotable examples are the gerontologist Aubrey de Grey and the polymath and inventor Ray Kurzweil\n(winner of the 1999 US National Medal of Technology and Innovation). In 2012 Kurzweil was\nappointed a director of engineering at Google, and a year later Google launched a sub-company\ncalled Calico whose stated mission is \u2018to solve death\u2019.\n26 Google has recently appointed another\nimmortality true-believer, Bill Maris, to preside over the Google Ventures investment fund. In a\nJanuary 2015 interview, Maris said, \u2018If you ask me today, is it possible to live to be 500, the answer\nis yes.\u2019 Maris backs up his brave words with a lot of hard cash. Google Ventures is investing 36 per\ncent of its $2 billion portfolio in life sciences start-ups, including several ambitious life-extending\nprojects. Using an American football analogy, Maris explained that in the fight against death, \u2018We\naren\u2019t trying to gain a few yards. We are trying to win the game.\u2019 Why? Because, says Maris, \u2018it is\nbetter to live than to die\u2019.\n27\nSuch dreams are shared by other Silicon Valley luminaries. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has\nrecently confessed that he aims to live for ever. \u2018I think there are probably three main modes of\napproaching [death],\u2019 he explained. \u2018You can accept it, you can deny it or you can fight it. I think our\nsociety is dominated by people who are into denial or acceptance, and I prefer to fight it.\u2019 Many\npeople are likely to dismiss such statements as teenage fantasies. Yet Thiel is somebody to be taken\nvery seriously. He is one of the most successful and influential entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley with a\nprivate fortune estimated at $2.2 billion.\n28 The writing is on the wall: equality is out \u2013 immortality is\nin.\nThe breakneck development of fields such as genetic engineering, regenerative medicine and\nnanotechnology fosters ever more optimistic prophecies. Some experts believe that humans will\novercome death by 2200, others say 2100. Kurzweil and de Grey are even more sanguine. They\nmaintain that anyone possessing a healthy body and a healthy bank account in 2050 will have a\nserious shot at immortality by cheating death a decade at a time. According to Kurzweil and de Grey,\nevery ten years or so we will march into the clinic and receive a makeover treatment that will not\nonly cure illnesses, but will also regenerate decaying tissues, and upgrade hands, eyes and brains.\nBefore the next treatment is due, doctors will have invented a plethora of new medicines, upgrades\nand gadgets. If Kurzweil and de Grey are right, there may already be some immortals walking next to\nyou on the street \u2013 at least if you happen to be walking down Wall Street or Fifth Avenue.\nIn truth they will actually be a-mortal, rather than immortal. Unlike God, future superhumans could\nstill die in some war or accident, and nothing could bring them back from the netherworld. However,\nunlike us mortals, their life would have no expiry date. So long as no bomb shreds them to pieces or\nno truck runs them over, they could go on living indefinitely. Which will probably make them the most\nanxious people in history. We mortals daily take chances with our lives, because we know they are\ngoing to end anyhow. So we go on treks in the Himalayas, swim in the sea, and do many other\ndangerous things like crossing the street or eating out. But if you believe you can live for ever, you\nwould be crazy to gamble on infinity like that.\nPerhaps, then, we had better start with more modest aims, such as doubling life expectancy? In the\ntwentieth century we have almost doubled life expectancy from forty to seventy, so in the twenty-first\ncentury we should at least be able to double it again to 150. Though falling far short of immortality,\nthis would still revolutionise human society. For starters, family structure, marriages and child\u2013parent\nrelationships would be transformed. Today, people still expect to be married \u2018till death us do part\u2019,\nand much of life revolves around having and raising children. Now try to imagine a person with a\nlifespan of 150 years. Getting married at forty, she still has 110 years to go. Will it be realistic to\nexpect her marriage to last 110 years? Even Catholic fundamentalists might baulk at that. So the\ncurrent trend of serial marriages is likely to intensify. Bearing two children in her forties, she will, by\nthe time she is 120, have only a distant memory of the years she spent raising them \u2013 a rather minor\nepisode in her long life. It\u2019s hard to tell what kind of new parent\u2013child relationship might develop\nunder such circumstances.\nOr consider professional careers. Today we assume that you learn a profession in your teens and\ntwenties, and then spend the rest of your life in that line of work. You obviously learn new things even\nin your forties and fifties, but life is generally divided into a learning period followed by a working\nperiod. When you live to be 150 that won\u2019t do, especially in a world that is constantly being shaken\nby new technologies. People will have much longer careers, and will have to reinvent themselves\nagain and again even at the age of ninety.\nAt the same time, people will not retire at sixty-five and will not make way for the new generation\nwith its novel ideas and aspirations. The physicist Max Planck famously said that science advances\none funeral at a time. He meant that only when one generation passes away do new theories have a\nchance to root out old ones. This is true not only of science. Think for a moment about your own\nworkplace. No matter whether you are a scholar, journalist, cook or football player, how would you\nfeel if your boss were 120, his ideas were formulated when Victoria was still queen, and he was\nlikely to stay your boss for a couple of decades more?\nIn the political sphere the results might be even more sinister. Would you mind having Putin stick\naround for another ninety years? On second thoughts, if people lived to 150, then in 2016 Stalin\nwould still be ruling in Moscow, going strong at 138, Chairman Mao would be a middle-aged 123-\nyear-old, and Princess Elizabeth would be sitting on her hands waiting to inherit from the 121-yearold George VI. Her son Charles would not get his turn until 2076.\nComing back to the realm of reality, it is far from certain whether Kurzweil\u2019s and de Grey\u2019s\nprophecies will come true by 2050 or 2100. My own view is that the hopes of eternal youth in the\ntwenty-first century are premature, and whoever takes them too seriously is in for a bitter\ndisappointment. It is not easy to live knowing that you are going to die, but it is even harder to believe\nin immortality and be proven wrong.\nAlthough average life expectancy has doubled over the last hundred years, it is unwarranted to\nextrapolate and conclude that we can double it again to 150 in the coming century. In 1900 global life\nexpectancy was no higher than forty because many people died young from malnutrition, infectious\ndiseases and violence. Yet those who escaped famine, plague and war could live well into their\nseventies and eighties, which is the natural life span of Homo sapiens. Contrary to common notions,\nseventy-year-olds weren\u2019t considered rare freaks of nature in previous centuries. Galileo Galilei\ndied at seventy-seven, Isaac Newton at eighty-four, and Michelangelo lived to the ripe age of eightyeight, without any help from antibiotics, vaccinations or organ transplants. Indeed, even chimpanzees\nin the jungle sometimes live into their sixties.\n29\nIn truth, so far modern medicine hasn\u2019t extended our natural life span by a single year. Its great\nachievement has been to save us from premature death, and allow us to enjoy the full measure of our\nyears. Even if we now overcome cancer, diabetes and the other major killers, it would mean only that\nalmost everyone will get to live to ninety \u2013 but it will not be enough to reach 150, let alone 500. For\nthat, medicine will need to re-engineer the most fundamental structures and processes of the human\nbody, and discover how to regenerate organs and tissues. It is by no means clear that we can do that\nby 2100.\nNevertheless, every failed attempt to overcome death will get us a step closer to the target, and that\nwill inspire greater hopes and encourage people to make even greater efforts. Though Google\u2019s\nCalico probably won\u2019t solve death in time to make Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page\nimmortal, it will most probably make significant discoveries about cell biology, genetic medicines\nand human health. The next generation of Googlers could therefore start their attack on death from\nnew and better positions. The scientists who cry immortality are like the boy who cried wolf: sooner\nor later, the wolf actually comes.\nHence even if we don\u2019t achieve immortality in our lifetime, the war against death is still likely to\nbe the flagship project of the coming century. When you take into account our belief in the sanctity of\nhuman life, add the dynamics of the scientific establishment, and top it all with the needs of the\ncapitalist economy, a relentless war against death seems to be inevitable. Our ideological\ncommitment to human life will never allow us simply to accept human death. As long as people die of\nsomething, we will strive to overcome it.\nThe scientific establishment and the capitalist economy will be more than happy to underwrite this\nstruggle. Most scientists and bankers don\u2019t care what they are working on, provided it gives them an\nopportunity to make new discoveries and greater profits. Can anyone imagine a more exciting\nscientific challenge than outsmarting death \u2013 or a more promising market than the market of eternal\nyouth? If you are over forty, close your eyes for a minute and try to remember the body you had at\ntwenty-five. Not only how it looked, but above all how it felt. If you could have that body back, how\nmuch would you be willing to pay for it? No doubt some people would be happy to forgo the\nopportunity, but enough customers would pay whatever it takes, constituting a well-nigh infinite\nmarket.\nIf all that is not enough, the fear of death ingrained in most humans will give the war against death\nan irresistible momentum. As long as people assumed that death is inevitable, they trained themselves\nfrom an early age to suppress the desire to live for ever, or harnessed it in favour of substitute goals.\nPeople want to live for ever, so they compose an \u2018immortal\u2019 symphony, they strive for \u2018eternal glory\u2019\nin some war, or even sacrifice their lives so that their souls will \u2018enjoy everlasting bliss in paradise\u2019.\nA large part of our artistic creativity, our political commitment and our religious piety is fuelled by\nthe fear of death.\nWoody Allen, who has made a fabulous career out of the fear of death, was once asked if he hoped\nto live on for ever through the silver screen. Allen answered that \u2018I\u2019d rather live on in my apartment.\u2019\nHe went on to add that \u2018I don\u2019t want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it by\nnot dying.\u2019 Eternal glory, nationalist remembrance ceremonies and dreams of paradise are very poor\nsubstitutes for what humans like Allen really want \u2013 not to die. Once people think (with or without\ngood reason) that they have a serious chance of escaping death, the desire for life will refuse to go on\npulling the rickety wagon of art, ideology and religion, and will sweep forward like an avalanche.\nIf you think that religious fanatics with burning eyes and flowing beards are ruthless, just wait and\nsee what elderly retail moguls and ageing Hollywood starlets will do when they think the elixir of life\nis within reach. If and when science makes significant progress in the war against death, the real\nbattle will shift from the laboratories to the parliaments, courthouses and streets. Once the scientific\nefforts are crowned with success, they will trigger bitter political conflicts. All the wars and conflicts\nof history might turn out to be but a pale prelude for the real struggle ahead of us: the struggle for\neternal youth.\nThe Right to Happiness\nThe second big project on the human agenda will probably be to find the key to happiness.\nThroughout history numerous thinkers, prophets and ordinary people defined happiness rather than\nlife itself as the supreme good. In ancient Greece the philosopher Epicurus explained that\nworshipping gods is a waste of time, that there is no existence after death, and that happiness is the\nsole purpose of life. Most people in ancient times rejected Epicureanism, but today it has become the\ndefault view. Scepticism about the afterlife drives humankind to seek not only immortality, but also\nearthly happiness. For who would like to live for ever in eternal misery?\nFor Epicurus the pursuit of happiness was a personal quest. Modern thinkers, in contrast, tend to\nsee it as a collective project. Without government planning, economic resources and scientific\nresearch, individuals will not get far in their quest for happiness. If your country is torn apart by war,\nif the economy is in crisis and if health care is non-existent, you are likely to be miserable. At the end\nof the eighteenth century the British philosopher Jeremy Bentham declared that the supreme good is\n\u2018the greatest happiness of the greatest number\u2019, and concluded that the sole worthy aim of the state,\nthe market and the scientific community is to increase global happiness. Politicians should make\npeace, business people should foster prosperity and scholars should study nature, not for the greater\nglory of king, country or God \u2013 but so that you and I could enjoy a happier life.\nDuring the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although many paid lip service to Bentham\u2019s vision,\ngovernments, corporations and laboratories focused on more immediate and well-defined aims.\nCountries measured their success by the size of their territory, the increase in their population and the\ngrowth of their GDP \u2013 not by the happiness of their citizens. Industrialised nations such as Germany,\nFrance and Japan established gigantic systems of education, health and welfare, yet these systems\nwere aimed to strengthen the nation rather than ensure individual well-being.\nSchools were founded to produce skilful and obedient citizens who would serve the nation loyally.\nAt eighteen, youths needed to be not only patriotic but also literate, so that they could read the\nbrigadier\u2019s order of the day and draw up tomorrow\u2019s battle plans. They had to know mathematics in\norder to calculate the shell\u2019s trajectory or crack the enemy\u2019s secret code. They needed a reasonable\ncommand of electrics, mechanics and medicine, in order to operate wireless sets, drive tanks and take\ncare of wounded comrades. When they left the army they were expected to serve the nation as clerks,\nteachers and engineers, building a modern economy and paying lots of taxes.\nThe same went for the health system. At the end of the nineteenth century countries such as France,\nGermany and Japan began providing free health care for the masses. They financed vaccinations for\ninfants, balanced diets for children and physical education for teenagers. They drained festering\nswamps, exterminated mosquitoes and built centralised sewage systems. The aim wasn\u2019t to make\npeople happy, but to make the nation stronger. The country needed sturdy soldiers and workers,\nhealthy women who would give birth to more soldiers and workers, and bureaucrats who came to the\noffice punctually at 8 a.m. instead of lying sick at home.\nEven the welfare system was originally planned in the interest of the nation rather than of needy\nindividuals. When Otto von Bismarck pioneered state pensions and social security in late nineteenthcentury Germany, his chief aim was to ensure the loyalty of the citizens rather than to increase their\nwell-being. You fought for your country when you were eighteen, and paid your taxes when you were\nforty, because you counted on the state to take care of you when you were seventy.\n30\nIn 1776 the Founding Fathers of the United States established the right to the pursuit of happiness as\none of three unalienable human rights, alongside the right to life and the right to liberty. It\u2019s important\nto note, however, that the American Declaration of Independence guaranteed the right to the pursuit\nof happiness, not the right to happiness itself. Crucially, Thomas Jefferson did not make the state\nresponsible for its citizens\u2019 happiness. Rather, he sought only to limit the power of the state. The idea\nwas to reserve for individuals a private sphere of choice, free from state supervision. If I think I\u2019ll be\nhappier marrying John rather than Mary, living in San Francisco rather than Salt Lake City, and\nworking as a bartender rather than a dairy farmer, then it\u2019s my right to pursue happiness my way, and\nthe state shouldn\u2019t intervene even if I make the wrong choice.\nYet over the last few decades the tables have turned, and Bentham\u2019s vision has been taken far more\nseriously. People increasingly believe that the immense systems established more than a century ago\nto strengthen the nation should actually serve the happiness and well-being of individual citizens. We\nare not here to serve the state \u2013 it is here to serve us. The right to the pursuit of happiness, originally\nenvisaged as a restraint on state power, has imperceptibly morphed into the right to happiness \u2013 as if\nhuman beings have a natural right to be happy, and anything which makes us dissatisfied is a violation\nof our basic human rights, so the state should do something about it.\nIn the twentieth century per capita GDP was perhaps the supreme yardstick for evaluating national\nsuccess. From this perspective, Singapore, each of whose citizens produces on average $56,000\nworth of goods and services a year, is a more successful country than Costa Rica, whose citizens\nproduce only $14,000 a year. But nowadays thinkers, politicians and even economists are calling to\nsupplement or even replace GDP with GDH \u2013 gross domestic happiness. After all, what do people\nwant? They don\u2019t want to produce. They want to be happy. Production is important because it\nprovides the material basis for happiness. But it is only the means, not the end. In one survey after\nanother Costa Ricans report far higher levels of life satisfaction than Singaporeans. Would you rather\nbe a highly productive but dissatisfied Singaporean, or a less productive but satisfied Costa Rican?\nThis kind of logic might drive humankind to make happiness its second main goal for the twentyfirst century. At first glance this might seem a relatively easy project. If famine, plague and war are\ndisappearing, if humankind experiences unprecedented peace and prosperity, and if life expectancy\nincreases dramatically, surely all that will make humans happy, right?\nWrong. When Epicurus defined happiness as the supreme good, he warned his disciples that it is\nhard work to be happy. Material achievements alone will not satisfy us for long. Indeed, the blind\npursuit of money, fame and pleasure will only make us miserable. Epicurus recommended, for\nexample, to eat and drink in moderation, and to curb one\u2019s sexual appetites. In the long run, a deep\nfriendship will make us more content than a frenzied orgy. Epicurus outlined an entire ethic of dos and\ndon\u2019ts to guide people along the treacherous path to happiness.\nEpicurus was apparently on to something. Being happy doesn\u2019t come easy. Despite our\nunprecedented achievements in the last few decades, it is far from obvious that contemporary people\nare significantly more satisfied than their ancestors in bygone years. Indeed, it is an ominous sign that\ndespite higher prosperity, comfort and security, the rate of suicide in the developed world is also\nmuch higher than in traditional societies.\nIn Peru, Guatemala, the Philippines and Albania \u2013 developing countries suffering from poverty and\npolitical instability \u2013 about one person in 100,000 commits suicide each year. In rich and peaceful\ncountries such as Switzerland, France, Japan and New Zealand, twenty-five people per 100,000 take\ntheir own lives annually. In 1985 most South Koreans were poor, uneducated and tradition-bound,\nliving under an authoritarian dictatorship. Today South Korea is a leading economic power, its\ncitizens are among the best educated in the world, and it enjoys a stable and comparatively liberal\ndemocratic regime. Yet whereas in 1985 about nine South Koreans per 100,000 killed themselves,\ntoday the annual rate of suicide has more than tripled to thirty per 100,000.\n31\nThere are of course opposite and far more encouraging trends. Thus the drastic decrease in child\nmortality has surely brought an increase in human happiness, and partially compensated people for the\nstress of modern life. Still, even if we are somewhat happier than our ancestors, the increase in our\nwell-being is far less than we might have expected. In the Stone Age, the average human had at his or\nher disposal about 4,000 calories of energy per day. This included not only food, but also the energy\ninvested in preparing tools, clothing, art and campfires. Today Americans use on average 228,000\ncalories of energy per person per day, to feed not only their stomachs but also their cars, computers,\nrefrigerators and televisions.\n32 The average American thus uses sixty times more energy than the\naverage Stone Age hunter-gatherer. Is the average American sixty times happier? We may well be\nsceptical about such rosy views.\nAnd even if we have overcome many of yesterday\u2019s miseries, attaining positive happiness may be\nfar more difficult than abolishing downright suffering. It took just a piece of bread to make a starving\nmedieval peasant joyful. How do you bring joy to a bored, overpaid and overweight engineer? The\nsecond half of the twentieth century was a golden age for the USA. Victory in the Second World War,\nfollowed by an even more decisive victory in the Cold War, turned it into the leading global\nsuperpower. Between 1950 and 2000 American GDP grew from $2 trillion to $12 trillion. Real per\ncapita income doubled. The newly invented contraceptive pill made sex freer than ever. Women,\ngays, African Americans and other minorities finally got a bigger slice of the American pie. A flood\nof cheap cars, refrigerators, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, laundry machines,\ntelephones, televisions and computers changed daily life almost beyond recognition. Yet studies have\nshown that American subjective well-being levels in the 1990s remained roughly the same as they\nwere in the 1950s.\n33\nIn Japan, average real income rose by a factor of five between 1958 and 1987, in one of the fastest\neconomic booms of history. This avalanche of wealth, coupled with myriad positive and negative\nchanges in Japanese lifestyles and social relations, had surprisingly little impact on Japanese\nsubjective well-being levels. The Japanese in the 1990s were as satisfied \u2013 or dissatisfied \u2013 as they\nwere in the 1950s.\n34\nIt appears that our happiness bangs against some mysterious glass ceiling that does not allow it to\ngrow despite all our unprecedented accomplishments. Even if we provide free food for everybody,\ncure all diseases and ensure world peace, it won\u2019t necessarily shatter that glass ceiling. Achieving\nreal happiness is not going to be much easier than overcoming old age and death.\nThe glass ceiling of happiness is held in place by two stout pillars, one psychological, the other\nbiological. On the psychological level, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective\nconditions. We don\u2019t become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we\nbecome satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve,\nexpectations balloon. Dramatic improvements in conditions, as humankind has experienced in recent\ndecades, translate into greater expectations rather than greater contentment. If we don\u2019t do something\nabout this, our future achievements too might leave us as dissatisfied as ever.\nOn the biological level, both our expectations and our happiness are determined by our\nbiochemistry, rather than by our economic, social or political situation. According to Epicurus, we\nare happy when we feel pleasant sensations and are free from unpleasant ones. Jeremy Bentham\nsimilarly maintained that nature gave dominion over man to two masters \u2013 pleasure and pain \u2013 and\nthey alone determine everything we do, say and think. Bentham\u2019s successor, John Stuart Mill,\nexplained that happiness is nothing but pleasure and freedom from pain, and that beyond pleasure and\npain there is no good and no evil. Anyone who tries to deduce good and evil from something else\n(such as the word of God, or the national interest) is fooling you, and perhaps fooling himself too.\n35\nIn the days of Epicurus such talk was blasphemous. In the days of Bentham and Mill it was radical\nsubversion. But in the early twenty-first century this is scientific orthodoxy. According to the life\nsciences, happiness and suffering are nothing but different balances of bodily sensations. We never\nreact to events in the outside world, but only to sensations in our own bodies. Nobody suffers because\nshe lost her job, because she got divorced or because the government went to war. The only thing that\nmakes people miserable is unpleasant sensations in their own bodies. Losing one\u2019s job can certainly\ntrigger depression, but depression itself is a kind of unpleasant bodily sensation. A thousand things\nmay make us angry, but anger is never an abstraction. It is always felt as a sensation of heat and\ntension in the body, which is what makes anger so infuriating. Not for nothing do we say that we\n\u2018burn\u2019 with anger.\nConversely, science says that nobody is ever made happy by getting a promotion, winning the\nlottery or even finding true love. People are made happy by one thing and one thing only \u2013 pleasant\nsensations in their bodies. Imagine that you are Mario G\u00f6tze, the attacking midfielder of the German\nfootball team in the 2014 World Cup Final against Argentina; 113 minutes have already elapsed,\nwithout a goal being scored. Only seven minutes remain before the dreaded penalty shoot-out. Some\n75,000 excited fans fill the Maracan\u00e3 stadium in Rio, with countless millions anxiously watching all\nover the world. You are a few metres from the Argentinian goal when Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle sends a\nmagnificent pass in your direction. You stop the ball with your chest, it drops down towards your leg,\nyou give it a kick in mid-air, and you see it fly past the Argentinian goalkeeper and bury itself deep\ninside the net. Goooooooal! The stadium erupts like a volcano. Tens of thousands of people roar like\nmad, your teammates are racing to hug and kiss you, millions of people back home in Berlin and\nMunich collapse in tears before the television screen. You are ecstatic, but not because of the ball in\nthe Argentinian net or the celebrations going on in crammed Bavarian Biergartens. You are actually\nreacting to the storm of sensations within you. Chills run up and down your spine, waves of electricity\nwash over your body, and it feels as if you are dissolving into millions of exploding energy balls.\nYou don\u2019t have to score the winning goal in the World Cup Final to feel such sensations. If you\nreceive an unexpected promotion at work, and start jumping for joy, you are reacting to the same kind\nof sensations. The deeper parts of your mind know nothing about football or about jobs. They know\nonly sensations. If you get a promotion, but for some reason don\u2019t feel any pleasant sensations \u2013 you\nwill not feel satisfied. The opposite is also true. If you have just been fired (or lost a decisive\nfootball match), but you are experiencing very pleasant sensations (perhaps because you popped\nsome pill), you might still feel on top of the world.\nThe bad news is that pleasant sensations quickly subside and sooner or later turn into unpleasant\nones. Even scoring the winning goal in the World Cup Final doesn\u2019t guarantee lifelong bliss. In fact, it\nmight all be downhill from there. Similarly, if last year I received an unexpected promotion at work, I\nmight still be occupying that new position, but the very pleasant sensations I experienced on hearing\nthe news disappeared within hours. If I want to feel those wonderful sensations again, I must get\nanother promotion. And another. And if I don\u2019t get a promotion, I might end up far more bitter and\nangry than if I had remained a humble pawn.\nThis is all the fault of evolution. For countless generations our biochemical system adapted to\nincreasing our chances of survival and reproduction, not our happiness. The biochemical system\nrewards actions conducive to survival and reproduction with pleasant sensations. But these are only\nan ephemeral sales gimmick. We struggle to get food and mates in order to avoid unpleasant\nsensations of hunger and to enjoy pleasing tastes and blissful orgasms. But nice tastes and blissful\norgasms don\u2019t last very long, and if we want to feel them again we have to go out looking for more\nfood and mates.\nWhat might have happened if a rare mutation had created a squirrel who, after eating a single nut,\nenjoys an everlasting sensation of bliss? Technically, this could actually be done by rewiring the\nsquirrel\u2019s brain. Who knows, perhaps it really happened to some lucky squirrel millions of years ago.\nBut if so, that squirrel enjoyed an extremely happy and extremely short life, and that was the end of\nthe rare mutation. For the blissful squirrel would not have bothered to look for more nuts, let alone\nmates. The rival squirrels, who felt hungry again five minutes after eating a nut, had much better\nchances of surviving and passing their genes to the next generation. For exactly the same reason, the\nnuts we humans seek to gather \u2013 lucrative jobs, big houses, good-looking partners \u2013 seldom satisfy us\nfor long.\nSome may say that this is not so bad, because it isn\u2019t the goal that makes us happy \u2013 it\u2019s the journey.\nClimbing Mount Everest is more satisfying than standing at the top; flirting and foreplay are more\nexciting than having an orgasm; and conducting groundbreaking lab experiments is more interesting\nthan receiving praise and prizes. Yet this hardly changes the picture. It just indicates that evolution\ncontrols us with a broad range of pleasures. Sometimes it seduces us with sensations of bliss and\ntranquillity, while on other occasions it goads us forward with thrilling sensations of elation and\nexcitement.\nWhen an animal is looking for something that increases its chances of survival and reproduction\n(e.g. food, partners or social status), the brain produces sensations of alertness and excitement, which\ndrive the animal to make even greater efforts because they are so very agreeable. In a famous\nexperiment scientists connected electrodes to the brains of several rats, enabling the animals to create\nsensations of excitement simply by pressing a pedal. When the rats were given a choice between tasty\nfood and pressing the pedal, they preferred the pedal (much like kids preferring to play video games\nrather than come down to dinner). The rats pressed the pedal again and again, until they collapsed\nfrom hunger and exhaustion.\n36 Humans too may prefer the excitement of the race to resting on the\nlaurels of success. Yet what makes the race so attractive is the exhilarating sensations that go along\nwith it. Nobody would have wanted to climb mountains, play video games or go on blind dates if\nsuch activities were accompanied solely by unpleasant sensations of stress, despair or boredom.\n37\nAlas, the exciting sensations of the race are as transient as the blissful sensations of victory. The\nDon Juan enjoying the thrill of a one-night stand, the businessman enjoying biting his fingernails\nwatching the Dow Jones rise and fall, and the gamer enjoying killing monsters on the computer screen\nwill find no satisfaction remembering yesterday\u2019s adventures. Like the rats pressing the pedal again\nand again, the Don Juans, business tycoons and gamers need a new kick every day. Worse still, here\ntoo expectations adapt to conditions, and yesterday\u2019s challenges all too quickly become today\u2019s\ntedium. Perhaps the key to happiness is neither the race nor the gold medal, but rather combining the\nright doses of excitement and tranquillity; but most of us tend to jump all the way from stress to\nboredom and back, remaining as discontented with one as with the other.\nIf science is right and our happiness is determined by our biochemical system, then the only way to\nensure lasting contentment is by rigging this system. Forget economic growth, social reforms and\npolitical revolutions: in order to raise global happiness levels, we need to manipulate human\nbiochemistry. And this is exactly what we have begun doing over the last few decades. Fifty years\nago psychiatric drugs carried a severe stigma. Today, that stigma has been broken. For better or\nworse, a growing percentage of the population is taking psychiatric medicines on a regular basis, not\nonly to cure debilitating mental illnesses, but also to face more mundane depressions and the\noccasional blues.\nFor example, increasing numbers of schoolchildren take stimulants such as Ritalin. In 2011, 3.5\nmillion American children were taking medications for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder). In the UK the number rose from 92,000 in 1997 to 786,000 in 2012.\n38 The original aim had\nbeen to treat attention disorders, but today completely healthy kids take such medications to improve\ntheir performance and live up to the growing expectations of teachers and parents.\n39 Many object to\nthis development and argue that the problem lies with the education system rather than with the\nchildren. If pupils suffer from attention disorders, stress and low grades, perhaps we ought to blame\noutdated teaching methods, overcrowded classrooms and an unnaturally fast tempo of life. Maybe we\nshould modify the schools rather than the kids? It is interesting to see how the arguments have\nevolved. People have been quarrelling about education methods for thousands of years. Whether in\nancient China or Victorian Britain, everybody had his or her pet method, and vehemently opposed all\nalternatives. Yet hitherto everybody still agreed on one thing: in order to improve education, we need\nto change the schools. Today, for the first time in history, at least some people think it would be more\nefficient to change the pupils\u2019 biochemistry.\n40\nArmies are heading the same way: 12 per cent of American soldiers in Iraq and 17 per cent of\nAmerican soldiers in Afghanistan took either sleeping pills or antidepressants to help them deal with\nthe pressure and distress of war. Fear, depression and trauma are not caused by shells, booby traps or\ncar bombs. They are caused by hormones, neurotransmitters and neural networks. Two soldiers may\nfind themselves shoulder to shoulder in the same ambush; one will freeze in terror, lose his wits and\nsuffer from nightmares for years after the event; the other will charge forward courageously and win a\nmedal. The difference is in the soldiers\u2019 biochemistry, and if we find ways to control it we will at one\nstroke produce both happier soldiers and more efficient armies.\n41\nThe biochemical pursuit of happiness is also the number one cause of crime in the world. In 2009\nhalf of the inmates in US federal prisons got there because of drugs; 38 per cent of Italian prisoners\nwere convicted of drug-related offences; 55 per cent of inmates in the UK reported that they\ncommitted their crimes in connection with either consuming or trading drugs. A 2001 report found that\n62 per cent of Australian convicts were under the influence of drugs when committing the crime for\nwhich they were incarcerated.\n42 People drink alcohol to forget, they smoke pot to feel peaceful, they\ntake cocaine and methamphetamines to be sharp and confident, whereas Ecstasy provides ecstatic\nsensations and LSD sends you to meet Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. What some people hope to get\nby studying, working or raising a family, others try to obtain far more easily through the right dosage\nof molecules. This is an existential threat to the social and economic order, which is why countries\nwage a stubborn, bloody and hopeless war on biochemical crime.\nThe state hopes to regulate the biochemical pursuit of happiness, separating \u2018bad\u2019 manipulations\nfrom \u2018good\u2019 ones. The principle is clear: biochemical manipulations that strengthen political stability,\nsocial order and economic growth are allowed and even encouraged (e.g. those that calm hyperactive\nkids in school, or drive anxious soldiers forward into battle). Manipulations that threaten stability and\ngrowth are banned. But each year new drugs are born in the research labs of universities,\npharmaceutical companies and criminal organisations, and the needs of the state and the market also\nkeep changing. As the biochemical pursuit of happiness accelerates, so it will reshape politics,\nsociety and economics, and it will become ever harder to bring it under control.\nAnd drugs are just the beginning. In research labs experts are already working on more\nsophisticated ways of manipulating human biochemistry, such as sending direct electrical stimuli to\nappropriate spots in the brain, or genetically engineering the blueprints of our bodies. No matter the\nexact method, gaining happiness through biological manipulation won\u2019t be easy, for it requires\naltering the fundamental patterns of life. But then it wasn\u2019t easy to overcome famine, plague and war\neither.\nIt is far from certain that humankind should invest so much effort in the biochemical pursuit of\nhappiness. Some would argue that happiness simply isn\u2019t important enough, and that it is misguided to\nregard individual satisfaction as the highest aim of human society. Others may agree that happiness is\nindeed the supreme good, yet would take issue with the biological definition of happiness as the\nexperience of pleasant sensations.\nSome 2,300 years ago Epicurus warned his disciples that immoderate pursuit of pleasure is likely\nto make them miserable rather than happy. A couple of centuries earlier Buddha had made an even\nmore radical claim, teaching that the pursuit of pleasant sensations is in fact the very root of suffering.\nSuch sensations are just ephemeral and meaningless vibrations. Even when we experience them, we\ndon\u2019t react to them with contentment; rather, we just crave for more. Hence no matter how many\nblissful or exciting sensations I may experience, they will never satisfy me.\nIf I identify happiness with fleeting pleasant sensations, and crave to experience more and more of\nthem, I have no choice but to pursue them constantly. When I finally get them, they quickly disappear,\nand because the mere memory of past pleasures will not satisfy me, I have to start all over again.\nEven if I continue this pursuit for decades, it will never bring me any lasting achievement; on the\ncontrary, the more I crave these pleasant sensations, the more stressed and dissatisfied I will become.\nTo attain real happiness, humans need to slow down the pursuit of pleasant sensations, not accelerate\nit.\nThis Buddhist view of happiness has a lot in common with the biochemical view. Both agree that\npleasant sensations disappear as fast as they arise, and that as long as people crave pleasant\nsensations without actually experiencing them, they remain dissatisfied. However, this problem has\ntwo very different solutions. The biochemical solution is to develop products and treatments that will\nprovide humans with an unending stream of pleasant sensations, so we will never be without them.\nThe Buddha\u2019s suggestion was to reduce our craving for pleasant sensations, and not allow them to\ncontrol our lives. According to Buddha, we can train our minds to observe carefully how all\nsensations constantly arise and pass. When the mind learns to see our sensations for what they are \u2013\nephemeral and meaningless vibrations \u2013 we lose interest in pursuing them. For what is the point of\nrunning after something that disappears as fast as it arises?\nAt present, humankind has far greater interest in the biochemical solution. No matter what monks in\ntheir Himalayan caves or philosophers in their ivory towers say, for the capitalist juggernaut,\nhappiness is pleasure. Period. With each passing year our tolerance for unpleasant sensations\ndecreases, and our craving for pleasant sensations increases. Both scientific research and economic\nactivity are geared to that end, each year producing better painkillers, new ice-cream flavours, more\ncomfortable mattresses, and more addictive games for our smartphones, so that we will not suffer a\nsingle boring moment while waiting for the bus.\nAll this is hardly enough, of course. Since Homo sapiens was not adapted by evolution to\nexperience constant pleasure, if that is what humankind nevertheless wants, ice cream and smartphone\ngames will not do. It will be necessary to change our biochemistry and re-engineer our bodies and\nminds. So we are working on that. You may debate whether it is good or bad, but it seems that the\nsecond great project of the twenty-first century \u2013 to ensure global happiness \u2013 will involve reengineering Homo sapiens so that it can enjoy everlasting pleasure.\nThe Gods of Planet Earth\nIn seeking bliss and immortality humans are in fact trying to upgrade themselves into gods. Not just\nbecause these are divine qualities, but because in order to overcome old age and misery humans will\nfirst have to acquire godlike control of their own biological substratum. If we ever have the power to\nengineer death and pain out of our system, that same power will probably be sufficient to engineer our\nsystem in almost any manner we like, and manipulate our organs, emotions and intelligence in myriad\nways. You could buy for yourself the strength of Hercules, the sensuality of Aphrodite, the wisdom of\nAthena or the madness of Dionysus if that is what you are into. Up till now increasing human power\nrelied mainly on upgrading our external tools. In the future it may rely more on upgrading the human\nbody and mind, or on merging directly with our tools.\nThe upgrading of humans into gods may follow any of three paths: biological engineering, cyborg\nengineering and the engineering of non-organic beings.\nBiological engineering starts with the insight that we are far from realising the full potential of\norganic bodies. For 4 billion years natural selection has been tweaking and tinkering with these\nbodies, so that we have gone from amoeba to reptiles to mammals to Sapiens. Yet there is no reason\nto think that Sapiens is the last station. Relatively small changes in genes, hormones and neurons were\nenough to transform Homo erectus \u2013 who could produce nothing more impressive than flint knives \u2013\ninto Homo sapiens, who produces spaceships and computers. Who knows what might be the outcome\nof a few more changes to our DNA, hormonal system or brain structure. Bioengineering is not going\nto wait patiently for natural selection to work its magic. Instead, bioengineers will take the old\nSapiens body, and intentionally rewrite its genetic code, rewire its brain circuits, alter its\nbiochemical balance, and even grow entirely new limbs. They will thereby create new godlings, who\nmight be as different from us Sapiens as we are different from Homo erectus.\nCyborg engineering will go a step further, merging the organic body with non-organic devices such\nas bionic hands, artificial eyes, or millions of nano-robots that will navigate our bloodstream,\ndiagnose problems and repair damage. Such a cyborg could enjoy abilities far beyond those of any\norganic body. For example, all parts of an organic body must be in direct contact with one another in\norder to function. If an elephant\u2019s brain is in India, its eyes and ears in China and its feet in Australia,\nthen this elephant is most probably dead, and even if it is in some mysterious sense alive, it cannot\nsee, hear or walk. A cyborg, in contrast, could exist in numerous places at the same time. A cyborg\ndoctor could perform emergency surgeries in Tokyo, in Chicago and in a space station on Mars,\nwithout ever leaving her Stockholm office. She will need only a fast Internet connection, and a few\npairs of bionic eyes and hands. On second thoughts, why pairs? Why not quartets? Indeed, even those\nare actually superfluous. Why should a cyborg doctor hold a surgeon\u2019s scalpel by hand, when she\ncould connect her mind directly to the instrument?\nThis may sound like science fiction, but it\u2019s already a reality. Monkeys have recently learned to\ncontrol bionic hands and feet disconnected from their bodies, through electrodes implanted in their\nbrains. Paralysed patients are able to move bionic limbs or operate computers by the power of\nthought alone. If you wish, you can already remote-control electric devices in your house using an\nelectric \u2018mind-reading\u2019 helmet. The helmet requires no brain implants. It functions by reading the\nelectric signals passing through your scalp. If you want to turn on the light in the kitchen, you just\nwear the helmet, imagine some preprogrammed mental sign (e.g. imagine your right hand moving),\nand the switch turns on. You can buy such helmets online for a mere $400.\n43\nIn early 2015 several hundred workers in the Epicenter high-tech hub in Stockholm had microchips\nimplanted into their hands. The chips are about the size of a grain of rice and store personalised\nsecurity information that enables workers to open doors and operate photocopiers with a wave of\ntheir hand. Soon they hope to make payments in the same way. One of the people behind the initiative,\nHannes Sjoblad, explained that \u2018We already interact with technology all the time. Today it\u2019s a bit\nmessy: we need pin codes and passwords. Wouldn\u2019t it be easy to just touch with your hand?\u2019\n44\nYet even cyborg engineering is relatively conservative, inasmuch as it assumes that organic brains\nwill go on being the command-and-control centres of life. A bolder approach dispenses with organic\nparts altogether, and hopes to engineer completely non-organic beings. Neural networks will be\nreplaced by intelligent software, which could surf both the virtual and non-virtual worlds, free from\nthe limitations of organic chemistry. After 4 billion years of wandering inside the kingdom of organic\ncompounds, life will break out into the vastness of the inorganic realm, and will take shapes that we\ncannot envision even in our wildest dreams. After all, our wildest dreams are still the product of\norganic chemistry.\nWe don\u2019t know where these paths might lead us, nor what our godlike descendants will look like.\nForetelling the future was never easy, and revolutionary biotechnologies make it even harder. For as\ndifficult as it is to predict the impact of new technologies in fields like transportation, communication\nand energy, technologies for upgrading humans pose a completely different kind of challenge. Since\nthey can be used to transform human minds and desires, people possessing present-day minds and\ndesires by definition cannot fathom their implications.\nFor thousands of years history was full of technological, economic, social and political upheavals.\nYet one thing remained constant: humanity itself. Our tools and institutions are very different from\nthose of biblical times, but the deep structures of the human mind remain the same. This is why we\ncan still find ourselves between the pages of the Bible, in the writings of Confucius or within the\ntragedies of Sophocles and Euripides. These classics were created by humans just like us, hence we\nfeel that they talk about us. In modern theatre productions, Oedipus, Hamlet and Othello may wear\njeans and T-shirts and have Facebook accounts, but their emotional conflicts are the same as in the\noriginal play.\nHowever, once technology enables us to re-engineer human minds, Homo sapiens will disappear,\nhuman history will come to an end and a completely new kind of process will begin, which people\nlike you and me cannot comprehend. Many scholars try to predict how the world will look in the year\n2100 or 2200. This is a waste of time. Any worthwhile prediction must take into account the ability to\nre-engineer human minds, and this is impossible. There are many wise answers to the question, \u2018What\nwould people with minds like ours do with biotechnology?\u2019 Yet there are no good answers to the\nquestion, \u2018What would beings with a dif erent kind of mind do with biotechnology?\u2019 All we can say\nis that people similar to us are likely to use biotechnology to re-engineer their own minds, and our\npresent-day minds cannot grasp what might happen next.\nThough the details are therefore obscure, we can nevertheless be sure about the general direction\nof history. In the twenty-first century, the third big project of humankind will be to acquire for us\ndivine powers of creation and destruction, and upgrade Homo sapiens into Homo deus. This third\nproject obviously subsumes the first two projects, and is fuelled by them. We want the ability to reengineer our bodies and minds in order, above all, to escape old age, death and misery, but once we\nhave it, who knows what else we might do with such ability? So we may well think of the new human\nagenda as consisting really of only one project (with many branches): attaining divinity.\nIf this sounds unscientific or downright eccentric, it is because people often misunderstand the\nmeaning of divinity. Divinity isn\u2019t a vague metaphysical quality. And it isn\u2019t the same as omnipotence.\nWhen speaking of upgrading humans into gods, think more in terms of Greek gods or Hindu devas\nrather than the omnipotent biblical sky father. Our descendants would still have their foibles, kinks\nand limitations, just as Zeus and Indra had theirs. But they could love, hate, create and destroy on a\nmuch grander scale than us.\nThroughout history most gods were believed to enjoy not omnipotence but rather specific superabilities such as the ability to design and create living beings; to transform their own bodies; to\ncontrol the environment and the weather; to read minds and to communicate at a distance; to travel at\nvery high speeds; and of course to escape death and live indefinitely. Humans are in the business of\nacquiring all these abilities, and then some. Certain traditional abilities that were considered divine\nfor many millennia have today become so commonplace that we hardly think about them. The average\nperson now moves and communicates across distances much more easily than the Greek, Hindu or\nAfrican gods of old.\nFor example, the Igbo people of Nigeria believe that the creator god Chukwu initially wanted to\nmake people immortal. He sent a dog to tell humans that when someone dies, they should sprinkle\nashes on the corpse, and the body will come back to life. Unfortunately, the dog was tired and he\ndallied on the way. The impatient Chukwu then sent a sheep, telling her to make haste with this\nimportant message. Alas, when the breathless sheep reached her destination, she garbled the\ninstructions, and told the humans to bury their dead, thus making death permanent. This is why to this\nday we humans must die. If only Chukwu had a Twitter account instead of relying on laggard dogs and\ndim-witted sheep to deliver his messages!\nIn ancient agricultural societies, most religions revolved not around metaphysical questions and the\nafterlife, but around the very mundane issue of increasing agricultural output. Thus the Old Testament\nGod never promises any rewards or punishments after death. He instead tells the people of Israel that\n\u2018If you carefully observe the commands that I\u2019m giving you [. . .] then I will send rain on the land in\nits season [. . .] and you\u2019ll gather grain, wine, and oil. I will provide grass in the fields for your\nlivestock, and you\u2019ll eat and be satisfied. Be careful! Otherwise, your hearts will deceive you and\nyou will turn away to serve other gods and worship them. The wrath of God will burn against you so\nthat he will restrain the heavens and it won\u2019t rain. The ground won\u2019t yield its produce and you\u2019ll be\nswiftly destroyed from the good land that the Lord is about to give you\u2019 (Deuteronomy 11:13\u201317).\nScientists today can do much better than the Old Testament God. Thanks to artificial fertilisers,\nindustrial insecticides and genetically modified crops, agricultural production nowadays outstrips the\nhighest expectations ancient farmers had of their gods. And the parched state of Israel no longer fears\nthat some angry deity will restrain the heavens and stop all rain \u2013 for the Israelis have recently built a\nhuge desalination plant on the shores of the Mediterranean, so they can now get all their drinking\nwater from the sea.\nSo far we have competed with the gods of old by creating better and better tools. In the not too\ndistant future, we might create superhumans who will outstrip the ancient gods not in their tools, but\nin their bodily and mental faculties. If and when we get there, however, divinity will become as\nmundane as cyberspace \u2013 a wonder of wonders that we just take for granted.\nWe can be quite certain that humans will make a bid for divinity, because humans have many\nreasons to desire such an upgrade, and many ways to achieve it. Even if one promising path turns out\nto be a dead end, alternative routes will remain open. For example, we may discover that the human\ngenome is far too complicated for serious manipulation, but this will not prevent the development of\nbrain\u2013computer interfaces, nano-robots or artificial intelligence.\nNo need to panic, though. At least not immediately. Upgrading Sapiens will be a gradual historical\nprocess rather than a Hollywood apocalypse. Homo sapiens is not going to be exterminated by a\nrobot revolt. Rather, Homo sapiens is likely to upgrade itself step by step, merging with robots and\ncomputers in the process, until our descendants will look back and realise that they are no longer the\nkind of animal that wrote the Bible, built the Great Wall of China and laughed at Charlie Chaplin\u2019s\nantics. This will not happen in a day, or a year. Indeed, it is already happening right now, through\ninnumerable mundane actions. Every day millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit\nmore control over their lives or try a new and more effective antidepressant drug. In pursuit of health,\nhappiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and\nanother, until they will no longer be human.\nCan Someone Please Hit the Brakes?\nCalm explanations aside, many people panic when they hear of such possibilities. They are happy to\nfollow the advice of their smartphones or to take whatever drug the doctor prescribes, but when they\nhear of upgraded superhumans, they say: \u2018I hope I will be dead before that happens.\u2019 A friend once\ntold me that what she fears most about growing old is becoming irrelevant, turning into a nostalgic old\nwoman who cannot understand the world around her, or contribute much to it. This is what we fear\ncollectively, as a species, when we hear of superhumans. We sense that in such a world, our identity,\nour dreams and even our fears will be irrelevant, and we will have nothing more to contribute.\nWhatever you are today \u2013 be it a devout Hindu cricket player or an aspiring lesbian journalist \u2013 in an\nupgraded world you will feel like a Neanderthal hunter in Wall Street. You won\u2019t belong.\nThe Neanderthals didn\u2019t have to worry about the Nasdaq, since they were shielded from it by tens\nof thousands of years. Nowadays, however, our world of meaning might collapse within decades. You\ncannot count on death to save you from becoming completely irrelevant. Even if gods don\u2019t walk our\nstreets by 2100, the attempt to upgrade Homo sapiens is likely to change the world beyond\nrecognition in this century. Scientific research and technological developments are moving at a far\nfaster rate than most of us can grasp.\nIf you speak with the experts, many of them will tell you that we are still very far away from\ngenetically engineered babies or human-level artificial intelligence. But most experts think on a\ntimescale of academic grants and college jobs. Hence, \u2018very far away\u2019 may mean twenty years, and\n\u2018never\u2019 may denote no more than fifty.\nI still remember the day I first came across the Internet. It was back in 1993, when I was in high\nschool. I went with a couple of buddies to visit our friend Ido (who is now a computer scientist). We\nwanted to play table tennis. Ido was already a huge computer fan, and before opening the ping-pong\ntable he insisted on showing us the latest wonder. He connected the phone cable to his computer and\npressed some keys. For a minute all we could hear were squeaks, shrieks and buzzes, and then\nsilence. It didn\u2019t succeed. We mumbled and grumbled, but Ido tried again. And again. And again. At\nlast he gave a whoop and announced that he had managed to connect his computer to the central\ncomputer at the nearby university. \u2018And what\u2019s there, on the central computer?\u2019 we asked. \u2018Well,\u2019 he\nadmitted, \u2018there\u2019s nothing there yet. But you could put all kinds of things there.\u2019 \u2018Like what?\u2019 we\nquestioned. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he said, \u2018all kinds of things.\u2019 It didn\u2019t sound very promising. We went to\nplay ping-pong, and for the following weeks enjoyed a new pastime, making fun of Ido\u2019s ridiculous\nidea. That was less than twenty-five years ago (at the time of writing). Who knows what will come to\npass twenty-five years from now?\nThat\u2019s why more and more individuals, organisations, corporations and governments are taking\nvery seriously the quest for immortality, happiness and godlike powers. Insurance companies, pension\nfunds, health systems and finance ministries are already aghast at the jump in life expectancy. People\nare living much longer than expected, and there is not enough money to pay for their pensions and\nmedical treatment. As seventy threatens to become the new forty, experts are calling to raise the\nretirement age, and to restructure the entire job market.\nWhen people realise how fast we are rushing towards the great unknown, and that they cannot count\neven on death to shield them from it, their reaction is to hope that somebody will hit the brakes and\nslow us down. But we cannot hit the brakes, for several reasons.\nFirstly, nobody knows where the brakes are. While some experts are familiar with developments in\none field, such as artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, big data or genetics, no one is an expert on\neverything. No one is therefore capable of connecting all the dots and seeing the full picture. Different\nfields influence one another in such intricate ways that even the best minds cannot fathom how\nbreakthroughs in artificial intelligence might impact nanotechnology, or vice versa. Nobody can\nabsorb all the latest scientific discoveries, nobody can predict how the global economy will look in\nten years, and nobody has a clue where we are heading in such a rush. Since no one understands the\nsystem any more, no one can stop it.\nSecondly, if we somehow succeed in hitting the brakes, our economy will collapse, along with our\nsociety. As explained in a later chapter, the modern economy needs constant and indefinite growth in\norder to survive. If growth ever stops, the economy won\u2019t settle down to some cosy equilibrium; it\nwill fall to pieces. That\u2019s why capitalism encourages us to seek immortality, happiness and divinity.\nThere\u2019s a limit to how many shoes we can wear, how many cars we can drive and how many skiing\nholidays we can enjoy. An economy built on everlasting growth needs endless projects \u2013 just like the\nquests for immortality, bliss and divinity.\nWell, if we need limitless projects, why not settle for bliss and immortality, and at least put aside\nthe frightening quest for superhuman powers? Because it is inextricable from the other two. When you\ndevelop bionic legs that enable paraplegics to walk again, you can also use the same technology to\nupgrade healthy people. When you discover how to stop memory loss among older people, the same\ntreatments might enhance the memory of the young.\nNo clear line separates healing from upgrading. Medicine almost always begins by saving people\nfrom falling below the norm, but the same tools and know-how can then be used to surpass the norm.\nViagra began life as a treatment for blood-pressure problems. To the surprise and delight of Pfizer, it\ntranspired that Viagra can also cure impotence. It enabled millions of men to regain normal sexual\nabilities; but soon enough men who had no impotence problems in the first place began using the same\npill to surpass the norm, and acquire sexual powers they never had before.\n45\nWhat happens to particular drugs can also happen to entire fields of medicine. Modern plastic\nsurgery was born in the First World War, when Harold Gillies began treating facial injuries in the\nAldershot military hospital.\n46 When the war was over, surgeons discovered that the same techniques\ncould also turn perfectly healthy but ugly noses into more beautiful specimens. Though plastic surgery\ncontinued to help the sick and wounded, it devoted increasing attention to upgrading the healthy.\nNowadays plastic surgeons make millions in private clinics whose explicit and sole aim is to\nupgrade the healthy and beautify the wealthy.\n47\nThe same might happen with genetic engineering. If a billionaire openly stated that he intended to\nengineer super-smart offspring, imagine the public outcry. But it won\u2019t happen like that. We are more\nlikely to slide down a slippery slope. It begins with parents whose genetic profile puts their children\nat high risk of deadly genetic diseases. So they perform in vitro fertilisation, and test the DNA of the\nfertilised egg. If everything is in order, all well and good. But if the DNA test discovers the dreaded\nmutations \u2013 the embryo is destroyed.\nYet why take a chance by fertilising just one egg? Better fertilise several, so that even if three or\nfour are defective there is at least one good embryo. When this in vitro selection procedure becomes\nacceptable and cheap enough, its usage may spread. Mutations are a ubiquitous risk. All people carry\nin their DNA some harmful mutations and less-than-optimal alleles. Sexual reproduction is a lottery.\n(A famous \u2013 and probably apocryphal \u2013 anecdote tells of a meeting in 1923 between Nobel Prize\nlaureate Anatole France and the beautiful and talented dancer Isadora Duncan. Discussing the then\npopular eugenics movement, Duncan said, \u2018Just imagine a child with my beauty and your brains!\u2019\nFrance responded, \u2018Yes, but imagine a child with my beauty and your brains.\u2019) Well then, why not rig\nthe lottery? Fertilise several eggs, and choose the one with the best combination. Once stem-cell\nresearch enables us to create an unlimited supply of human embryos on the cheap, you can select your\noptimal baby from among hundreds of candidates, all carrying your DNA, all perfectly natural, and\nnone requiring any futuristic genetic engineering. Iterate this procedure for a few generations, and you\ncould easily end up with superhumans (or a creepy dystopia).\nBut what if after fertilising even numerous eggs, you find that all of them contain some deadly\nmutations? Should you destroy all the embryos? Instead of doing that, why not replace the problematic\ngenes? A breakthrough case involves mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are tiny organelles within\nhuman cells, which produce the energy used by the cell. They have their own set of genes, which is\ncompletely separate from the DNA in the cell\u2019s nucleus. Defective mitochondrial DNA leads to\nvarious debilitating or even deadly diseases. It is technically feasible with current in vitro technology\nto overcome mitochondrial genetic diseases by creating a \u2018three-parent baby\u2019. The baby\u2019s nuclear\nDNA comes from two parents, while the mitochondrial DNA comes from a third person. In 2000\nSharon Saarinen from West Bloomfield, Michigan, gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Alana. Alana\u2019s\nnuclear DNA came from her mother, Sharon, and her father, Paul, but her mitochondrial DNA came\nfrom another woman. From a purely technical perspective, Alana has three biological parents. A year\nlater, in 2001, the US government banned this treatment, due to safety and ethical concerns.\n48\nHowever, on 3 February 2015 the British Parliament voted in favour of the so-called \u2018three-parent\nembryo\u2019 law, allowing this treatment \u2013 and related research \u2013 in the UK.\n49 At present it is technically\nunfeasible, and illegal, to replace nuclear DNA, but if and when the technical difficulties are solved,\nthe same logic that favoured the replacement of defective mitochondrial DNA would seem to warrant\ndoing the same with nuclear DNA.\nFollowing selection and replacement, the next potential step is amendment. Once it becomes\npossible to amend deadly genes, why go through the hassle of inserting some foreign DNA, when you\ncan just rewrite the code and turn a dangerous mutant gene into its benign version? Then we might\nstart using the same mechanism to fix not just lethal genes, but also those responsible for less deadly\nillnesses, for autism, for stupidity and for obesity. Who would like his or her child to suffer from any\nof these? Suppose a genetic test indicates that your would-be daughter will in all likelihood be smart,\nbeautiful and kind \u2013 but will suffer from chronic depression. Wouldn\u2019t you want to save her from\nyears of misery by a quick and painless intervention in the test tube?\nAnd while you are at it, why not give the child a little push? Life is hard and challenging even for\nhealthy people. So it would surely come in handy if the little girl had a stronger-than-normal immune\nsystem, an above-average memory or a particularly sunny disposition. And even if you don\u2019t want that\nfor your child \u2013 what if the neighbours are doing it for theirs? Would you have your child lag behind?\nAnd if the government forbids all citizens from engineering their babies, what if the North Koreans\nare doing it and producing amazing geniuses, artists and athletes that far outperform ours? And like\nthat, in baby steps, we are on our way to a genetic child catalogue.\nHealing is the initial justification for every upgrade. Find some professors experimenting in genetic\nengineering or brain\u2013computer interfaces, and ask them why they are engaged in such research. In all\nlikelihood they would reply that they are doing it to cure disease. \u2018With the help of genetic\nengineering,\u2019 they would explain, \u2018we could defeat cancer. And if we could connect brains and\ncomputers directly, we could cure schizophrenia.\u2019 Maybe, but it will surely not end there. When we\nsuccessfully connect brains and computers, will we use this technology only to cure schizophrenia? If\nanybody really believes this, then they may know a great deal about brains and computers, but far less\nabout the human psyche and human society. Once you achieve a momentous breakthrough, you cannot\nrestrict its use to healing and completely forbid using it for upgrading.\nOf course humans can and do limit their use of new technologies. Thus the eugenics movement fell\nfrom favour after the Second World War, and though trade in human organs is now both possible and\npotentially very lucrative, it has so far remained a peripheral activity. Designer babies may one day\nbecome as technologically feasible as murdering people to harvest their organs \u2013 yet remain as\nperipheral.\nJust as we have escaped the clutches of Chekhov\u2019s Law in warfare, we can also escape them in\nother fields of action. Some guns appear on stage without ever being fired. This is why it is so vital to\nthink about humanity\u2019s new agenda. Precisely because we have some choice regarding the use of new\ntechnologies, we had better understand what is happening and make up our minds about it before it\nmakes up our minds for us.\nThe Paradox of Knowledge\nThe prediction that in the twenty-first century humankind is likely to aim for immortality, bliss and\ndivinity may anger, alienate or frighten any number of people, so a few clarifications are in order.\nFirstly, this is not what most individuals will actually do in the twenty-first century. It is what\nhumankind as a collective will do. Most people will probably play only a minor role, if any, in these\nprojects. Even if famine, plague and war become less prevalent, billions of humans in developing\ncountries and seedy neighbourhoods will continue to deal with poverty, illness and violence even as\nthe elites are already reaching for eternal youth and godlike powers. This seems patently unjust. One\ncould argue that as long as there is a single child dying from malnutrition or a single adult killed in\ndrug-lord warfare, humankind should focus all its efforts on combating these woes. Only once the last\nsword is beaten into a ploughshare should we turn our minds to the next big thing. But history doesn\u2019t\nwork like that. Those living in palaces have always had different agendas to those living in shacks,\nand that is unlikely to change in the twenty-first century.\nSecondly, this is a historical prediction, not a political manifesto. Even if we disregard the fate of\nslum-dwellers, it is far from clear that we should be aiming at immortality, bliss and divinity.\nAdopting these particular projects might be a big mistake. But history is full of big mistakes. Given\nour past record and our current values, we are likely to reach out for bliss, divinity and immortality \u2013\neven if it kills us.\nThirdly, reaching out is not the same as obtaining. History is often shaped by exaggerated hopes.\nTwentieth-century Russian history was largely shaped by the communist attempt to overcome\ninequality, but it didn\u2019t succeed. My prediction is focused on what humankind will try to achieve in\nthe twenty-first century \u2013 not what it will succeed in achieving. Our future economy, society and\npolitics will be shaped by the attempt to overcome death. It does not follow that in 2100 humans will\nbe immortal.\nFourthly, and most importantly, this prediction is less of a prophecy and more a way of discussing\nour present choices. If the discussion makes us choose differently, so that the prediction is proven\nwrong, all the better. What\u2019s the point of making predictions if they cannot change anything?\nSome complex systems, such as the weather, are oblivious to our predictions. The process of\nhuman development, in contrast, reacts to them. Indeed, the better our forecasts, the more reactions\nthey engender. Hence paradoxically, as we accumulate more data and increase our computing power,\nevents become wilder and more unexpected. The more we know, the less we can predict. Imagine, for\nexample, that one day experts decipher the basic laws of the economy. Once this happens, banks,\ngovernments, investors and customers will begin to use this new knowledge to act in novel ways, and\ngain an edge over their competitors. For what is the use of new knowledge if it doesn\u2019t lead to novel\nbehaviours? Alas, once people change the way they behave, the economic theories become obsolete.\nWe may know how the economy functioned in the past \u2013 but we no longer understand how it functions\nin the present, not to mention the future.\nThis is not a hypothetical example. In the middle of the nineteenth century Karl Marx reached\nbrilliant economic insights. Based on these insights he predicted an increasingly violent conflict\nbetween the proletariat and the capitalists, ending with the inevitable victory of the former and the\ncollapse of the capitalist system. Marx was certain that the revolution would start in countries that\nspearheaded the Industrial Revolution \u2013 such as Britain, France and the USA \u2013 and spread to the rest\nof the world.\nMarx forgot that capitalists know how to read. At first only a handful of disciples took Marx\nseriously and read his writings. But as these socialist firebrands gained adherents and power, the\ncapitalists became alarmed. They too perused Das Kapital, adopting many of the tools and insights of\nMarxist analysis. In the twentieth century everybody from street urchins to presidents embraced a\nMarxist approach to economics and history. Even diehard capitalists who vehemently resisted the\nMarxist prognosis still made use of the Marxist diagnosis. When the CIA analysed the situation in\nVietnam or Chile in the 1960s, it divided society into classes. When Nixon or Thatcher looked at the\nglobe, they asked themselves who controls the vital means of production. From 1989 to 1991 George\nBush oversaw the demise of the Evil Empire of communism, only to be defeated in the 1992 elections\nby Bill Clinton. Clinton\u2019s winning campaign strategy was summarised in the motto: \u2018It\u2019s the economy,\nstupid.\u2019 Marx could not have said it better.\nAs people adopted the Marxist diagnosis, they changed their behaviour accordingly. Capitalists in\ncountries such as Britain and France strove to better the lot of the workers, strengthen their national\nconsciousness and integrate them into the political system. Consequently when workers began voting\nin elections and Labour gained power in one country after another, the capitalists could still sleep\nsoundly in their beds. As a result, Marx\u2019s predictions came to naught. Communist revolutions never\nengulfed the leading industrial powers such as Britain, France and the USA, and the dictatorship of\nthe proletariat was consigned to the dustbin of history.\nThis is the paradox of historical knowledge. Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless.\nBut knowledge that changes behaviour quickly loses its relevance. The more data we have and the\nbetter we understand history, the faster history alters its course, and the faster our knowledge\nbecomes outdated.\nCenturies ago human knowledge increased slowly, so politics and economics changed at a\nleisurely pace too. Today our knowledge is increasing at breakneck speed, and theoretically we\nshould understand the world better and better. But the very opposite is happening. Our new-found\nknowledge leads to faster economic, social and political changes; in an attempt to understand what is\nhappening, we accelerate the accumulation of knowledge, which leads only to faster and greater\nupheavals. Consequently we are less and less able to make sense of the present or forecast the future.\nIn 1016 it was relatively easy to predict how Europe would look in 1050. Sure, dynasties might fall,\nunknown raiders might invade, and natural disasters might strike; yet it was clear that in 1050 Europe\nwould still be ruled by kings and priests, that it would be an agricultural society, that most of its\ninhabitants would be peasants, and that it would continue to suffer greatly from famines, plagues and\nwars. In contrast, in 2016 we have no idea how Europe will look in 2050. We cannot say what kind\nof political system it will have, how its job market will be structured, or even what kind of bodies its\ninhabitants will possess.\nABrief History of Lawns\nIf history doesn\u2019t follow any stable rules, and if we cannot predict its future course, why study it? It\noften seems that the chief aim of science is to predict the future \u2013 meteorologists are expected to\nforecast whether tomorrow will bring rain or sunshine; economists should know whether devaluing\nthe currency will avert or precipitate an economic crisis; good doctors foresee whether chemotherapy\nor radiation therapy will be more successful in curing lung cancer. Similarly, historians are asked to\nexamine the actions of our ancestors so that we can repeat their wise decisions and avoid their\nmistakes. But it almost never works like that because the present is just too different from the past. It\nis a waste of time to study Hannibal\u2019s tactics in the Second Punic War so as to copy them in the Third\nWorld War. What worked well in cavalry battles will not necessarily be of much benefit in cyber\nwarfare.\nScience is not just about predicting the future, though. Scholars in all fields often seek to broaden\nour horizons, thereby opening before us new and unknown futures. This is especially true of history.\nThough historians occasionally try their hand at prophecy (without notable success), the study of\nhistory aims above all to make us aware of possibilities we don\u2019t normally consider. Historians study\nthe past not in order to repeat it, but in order to be liberated from it.\nEach and every one of us has been born into a given historical reality, ruled by particular norms\nand values, and managed by a unique economic and political system. We take this reality for granted,\nthinking it is natural, inevitable and immutable. We forget that our world was created by an accidental\nchain of events, and that history shaped not only our technology, politics and society, but also our\nthoughts, fears and dreams. The cold hand of the past emerges from the grave of our ancestors, grips\nus by the neck and directs our gaze towards a single future. We have felt that grip from the moment we\nwere born, so we assume that it is a natural and inescapable part of who we are. Therefore we\nseldom try to shake ourselves free, and envision alternative futures.\nStudying history aims to loosen the grip of the past. It enables us to turn our head this way and that,\nand begin to notice possibilities that our ancestors could not imagine, or didn\u2019t want us to imagine. By\nobserving the accidental chain of events that led us here, we realise how our very thoughts and\ndreams took shape \u2013 and we can begin to think and dream differently. Studying history will not tell us\nwhat to choose, but at least it gives us more options.\nMovements seeking to change the world often begin by rewriting history, thereby enabling people\nto reimagine the future. Whether you want workers to go on a general strike, women to take\npossession of their bodies, or oppressed minorities to demand political rights \u2013 the first step is to\nretell their history. The new history will explain that \u2018our present situation is neither natural nor\neternal. Things were different once. Only a string of chance events created the unjust world we know\ntoday. If we act wisely, we can change that world, and create a much better one.\u2019 This is why\nMarxists recount the history of capitalism; why feminists study the formation of patriarchal societies;\nand why African Americans commemorate the horrors of the slave trade. They aim not to perpetuate\nthe past, but rather to be liberated from it.\nWhat\u2019s true of grand social revolutions is equally true at the micro level of everyday life. A young\ncouple building a new home for themselves may ask the architect for a nice lawn in the front yard.\nWhy a lawn? \u2018Because lawns are beautiful,\u2019 the couple might explain. But why do they think so? It has\na history behind it.\nStone Age hunter-gatherers did not cultivate grass at the entrance to their caves. No green meadow\nwelcomed the visitors to the Athenian Acropolis, the Roman Capitol, the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem\nor the Forbidden City in Beijing. The idea of nurturing a lawn at the entrance to private residences\nand public buildings was born in the castles of French and English aristocrats in the late Middle\nAges. In the early modern age this habit struck deep roots, and became the trademark of nobility.\nWell-kept lawns demanded land and a lot of work, particularly in the days before lawnmowers and\nautomatic water sprinklers. In exchange, they produce nothing of value. You can\u2019t even graze animals\non them, because they would eat and trample the grass. Poor peasants could not afford wasting\nprecious land or time on lawns. The neat turf at the entrance to chateaux was accordingly a status\nsymbol nobody could fake. It boldly proclaimed to every passerby: \u2018I am so rich and powerful, and I\nhave so many acres and serfs, that I can afford this green extravaganza.\u2019 The bigger and neater the\nlawn, the more powerful the dynasty. If you came to visit a duke and saw that his lawn was in bad\nshape, you knew he was in trouble.\n50\nThe precious lawn was often the setting for important celebrations and social events, and at all\nother times was strictly off-limits. To this day, in countless palaces, government buildings and public\nvenues a stern sign commands people to \u2018Keep off the grass\u2019. In my former Oxford college the entire\nquad was formed of a large, attractive lawn, on which we were allowed to walk or sit on only one\nday a year. On any other day, woe to the poor student whose foot desecrated the holy turf.\nRoyal palaces and ducal chateaux turned the lawn into a symbol of authority. When in the late\nmodern period kings were toppled and dukes were guillotined, the new presidents and prime\nministers kept the lawns. Parliaments, supreme courts, presidential residences and other public\nbuildings increasingly proclaimed their power in row upon row of neat green blades. Simultaneously,\nlawns conquered the world of sports. For thousands of years humans played on almost every\nconceivable kind of ground, from ice to desert. Yet in the last two centuries, the really important\ngames \u2013 such as football and tennis \u2013 are played on lawns. Provided, of course, you have money. In\nthe favelas of Rio de Janeiro the future generation of Brazilian football is kicking makeshift balls\nover sand and dirt. But in the wealthy suburbs, the sons of the rich are enjoying themselves over\nmeticulously kept lawns.\nHumans thereby came to identify lawns with political power, social status and economic wealth.\nNo wonder that in the nineteenth century the rising bourgeoisie enthusiastically adopted the lawn. At\nfirst only bankers, lawyers and industrialists could afford such luxuries at their private residences.\nYet when the Industrial Revolution broadened the middle class and gave rise to the lawnmower and\nthen the automatic sprinkler, millions of families could suddenly afford a home turf. In American\nsuburbia a spick-and-span lawn switched from being a rich person\u2019s luxury into a middle-class\nnecessity.\nThis was when a new rite was added to the suburban liturgy. After Sunday morning service at\nchurch, many people devotedly mowed their lawns. Walking along the streets, you could quickly\nascertain the wealth and position of every family by the size and quality of their turf. There is no surer\nsign that something is wrong at the Joneses\u2019 than a neglected lawn in the front yard. Grass is\nnowadays the most widespread crop in the USA after maize and wheat, and the lawn industry (plants,\nmanure, mowers, sprinklers, gardeners) accounts for billions of dollars every year.\n51\nThe lawns of Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, in the Loire Valley. King Fran\u00e7ois I built it in the early sixteenth century. This is where it all began.\n\u00a9 CHICUREL Arnaud/Getty Images.\nA welcoming ceremony in honour of Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 on the White House lawn.\n\u00a9 American Spirit/Shutterstock.com.\nMario G\u00f6tze scores the decisive goal, giving Germany the World Cup in 2014 \u2013 on the Maracan\u00e3 lawn.\n\u00a9 Imagebank/Chris Brunskill/Getty Images/Bridgeman Images.\nPetit-bourgeois paradise.\n\u00a9 H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images.\nThe lawn did not remain solely a European or American craze. Even people who have never\nvisited the Loire Valley see US presidents giving speeches on the White House lawn, important\nfootball games played out in green stadiums, and Homer and Bart Simpson quarrelling about whose\nturn it is to mow the grass. People all over the globe associate lawns with power, money and\nprestige. The lawn has therefore spread far and wide, and is now set to conquer even the heart of the\nMuslim world. Qatar\u2019s newly built Museum of Islamic Art is flanked by magnificent lawns that hark\nback to Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles much more than to Haroun al-Rashid\u2019s Baghdad. They were designed\nand constructed by an American company, and their more than 100,000 square metres of grass \u2013 in the\nmidst of the Arabian desert \u2013 require a stupendous amount of fresh water each day to stay green.\nMeanwhile, in the suburbs of Doha and Dubai, middle-class families pride themselves on their\nlawns. If it were not for the white robes and black hijabs, you could easily think you were in the\nMidwest rather than the Middle East.\nHaving read this short history of the lawn, when you now come to plan your dream house you might\nthink twice about having a lawn in the front yard. You are of course still free to do it. But you are also\nfree to shake off the cultural cargo bequeathed to you by European dukes, capitalist moguls and the\nSimpsons \u2013 and imagine for yourself a Japanese rock garden, or some altogether new creation. This is\nthe best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and\nimagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom \u2013 we cannot avoid being shaped by\nthe past. But some freedom is better than none.\nAGun in Act I\nAll the predictions that pepper this book are no more than an attempt to discuss present-day\ndilemmas, and an invitation to change the future. Predicting that humankind will try to gain\nimmortality, bliss and divinity is much like predicting that people building a house will want a lawn\nin their front yard. It sounds very likely. But once you say it out loud, you can begin to think about\nalternatives.\nPeople are taken aback by dreams of immortality and divinity not because they sound so foreign\nand unlikely, but because it is uncommon to be so blunt. Yet when they start thinking about it, most\npeople realise that it actually makes a lot of sense. Despite the technological hubris of these dreams,\nideologically they are old news. For 300 years the world has been dominated by humanism, which\nsanctifies the life, happiness and power of Homo sapiens. The attempt to gain immortality, bliss and\ndivinity merely takes the long-standing humanist ideals to their logical conclusion. It places openly on\nthe table what we have for a long time kept hidden under our napkin.\nYet I would now like to place something else on the table: a gun. A gun that appears in Act I, to fire\nin Act III. The following chapters discuss how humanism \u2013 the worship of humankind \u2013 has\nconquered the world. Yet the rise of humanism also contains the seeds of its downfall. While the\nattempt to upgrade humans into gods takes humanism to its logical conclusion, it simultaneously\nexposes humanism\u2019s inherent flaws. If you start with a flawed ideal, you often appreciate its defects\nonly when the ideal is close to realisation.\nWe can already see this process at work in geriatric hospital wards. Due to an uncompromising\nhumanist belief in the sanctity of human life, we keep people alive till they reach such a pitiful state\nthat we are forced to ask, \u2018What exactly is so sacred here?\u2019 Due to similar humanist beliefs, in the\ntwenty-first century we are likely to push humankind as a whole beyond its limits. The same\ntechnologies that can upgrade humans into gods might also make humans irrelevant. For example,\ncomputers powerful enough to understand and overcome the mechanisms of ageing and death will\nprobably also be powerful enough to replace humans in any and all tasks.\nHence the real agenda in the twenty-first century is going to be far more complicated than what this\nlong opening chapter has suggested. At present it might seem that immortality, bliss and divinity\noccupy the top slots on our agenda. But once we come nearer to achieving these goals the resulting\nupheavals are likely to deflect us towards entirely different destinations. The future described in this\nchapter is merely the future of the past \u2013 i.e. a future based on the ideas and hopes that dominated the\nworld for the last 300 years. The real future \u2013 i.e. a future born of the new ideas and hopes of the\ntwenty-first century \u2013 might be completely different.\nTo understand all this we need to go back and investigate who Homo sapiens really is, how\nhumanism became the dominant world religion and why attempting to fulfil the humanist dream is\nlikely to cause its disintegration. This is the basic plan of the book.\nThe first part of the book looks at the relationship between Homo sapiens and other animals, in an\nattempt to comprehend what makes our species so special. Some readers may wonder why animals\nreceive so much attention in a book about the future. In my view, you cannot have a serious discussion\nabout the nature and future of humankind without beginning with our fellow animals. Homo sapiens\ndoes its best to forget the fact, but it is an animal. And it is doubly important to remember our origins\nat a time when we seek to turn ourselves into gods. No investigation of our divine future can ignore\nour own animal past, or our relations with other animals \u2013 because the relationship between humans\nand animals is the best model we have for future relations between superhumans and humans. You\nwant to know how super-intelligent cyborgs might treat ordinary flesh-and-blood humans? Better start\nby investigating how humans treat their less intelligent animal cousins. It\u2019s not a perfect analogy, of\ncourse, but it is the best archetype we can actually observe rather than just imagine.\nBased on the conclusions of this first part, the second part of the book examines the bizarre world\nHomo sapiens has created in the last millennia, and the path that took us to our present crossroads.\nHow did Homo sapiens come to believe in the humanist creed, according to which the universe\nrevolves around humankind and humans are the source of all meaning and authority? What are the\neconomic, social and political implications of this creed? How does it shape our daily life, our art\nand our most secret desires?\nThe third and last part of the book comes back to the early twenty-first century. Based on a much\ndeeper understanding of humankind and of the humanist creed, it describes our current predicament\nand our possible futures. Why might attempts to fulfil humanism result in its downfall? How would\nthe search for immortality, bliss and divinity shake the foundations of our belief in humanity? What\nsigns foretell this cataclysm, and how is it reflected in the day-to-day decisions each of us makes?\nAnd if humanism is indeed in danger, what might take its place? This part of the book does not consist\nof mere philosophising or idle future-telling. Rather, it scrutinises our smartphones, dating practices\nand job market for clues of things to come.\nFor humanist true-believers, all this may sound very pessimistic and depressing. But it is best not\nto jump to conclusions. History has witnessed the rise and fall of many religions, empires and\ncultures. Such upheavals are not necessarily bad. Humanism has dominated the world for 300 years,\nwhich is not such a long time. The pharaohs ruled Egypt for 3,000 years, and the popes dominated\nEurope for a millennium. If you told an Egyptian in the time of Ramses II that one day the pharaohs\nwill be gone, he would probably have been aghast. \u2018How can we live without a pharaoh? Who will\nensure order, peace and justice?\u2019 If you told people in the Middle Ages that within a few centuries\nGod will be dead, they would have been horrified. \u2018How can we live without God? Who will give\nlife meaning and protect us from chaos?\u2019\nLooking back, many think that the downfall of the pharaohs and the death of God were both positive\ndevelopments. Maybe the collapse of humanism will also be beneficial. People are usually afraid of\nchange because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything\nchanges.\nKing Ashurbanipal of Assyria slaying a lion: mastering the animal kingdom.\n\u00a9 De Agostini Picture Library/G. Nimatallah/Bridgeman Images.\nPART I\nHomo sapiens Conquers the World\nWhat is the dif erence between humans and all other animals?\nHow did our species conquer the world?\nIs Homo sapiens a superior life form, or just the local bully?\n2\nThe Anthropocene\nWith regard to other animals, humans have long since become gods. We don\u2019t like to reflect on this\ntoo deeply, because we have not been particularly just or merciful gods. If you watch the National\nGeographic channel, go to a Disney film or read a book of fairy tales, you might easily get the\nimpression that planet Earth is populated mainly by lions, wolves and tigers who are an equal match\nfor us humans. Simba the lion king holds sway over the forest animals; Little Red Riding Hood tries\nto evade the Big Bad Wolf; and little Mowgli bravely confronts Shere Khan the tiger. But in reality,\nthey are no longer there. Our televisions, books, fantasies and nightmares are still full of them, but the\nSimbas, Shere Khans and Big Bad Wolves of our planet are disappearing. The world is populated\nmainly by humans and their domesticated animals.\nHow many wolves live today in Germany, the land of the Grimm brothers, Little Red Riding Hood\nand the Big Bad Wolf? Less than a hundred. (And even these are mostly Polish wolves that stole over\nthe border in recent years.) In contrast, Germany is home to 5 million domesticated dogs. Altogether\nabout 200,000 wild wolves still roam the earth, but there are more than 400 million domesticated\ndogs.\n1 The world contains 40,000 lions compared to 600 million house cats; 900,000 African buffalo\nversus 1.5 billion domesticated cows; 50 million penguins and 20 billion chickens.\n2 Since 1970,\ndespite growing ecological awareness, wildlife populations have halved (not that they were\nprospering in 1970).\n3\nIn 1980 there were 2 billion wild birds in Europe. In 2009 only 1.6 billion\nwere left. In the same year, Europeans raised 1.9 billion chickens for meat and eggs.\n4 At present,\nmore than 90 per cent of the large animals of the world (i.e. those weighing more than a few\nkilograms) are either humans or domesticated animals.\nScientists divide the history of our planet into epochs such as the Pleistocene, the Pliocene and the\nMiocene. Officially, we live in the Holocene epoch. Yet it may be better to call the last 70,000 years\nthe Anthropocene epoch: the epoch of humanity. For during these millennia Homo sapiens became the\nsingle most important agent of change in the global ecology.\n5\nThis is an unprecedented phenomenon. Since the appearance of life, about 4 billion years ago,\nnever has a single species changed the global ecology all by itself. Though there had been no lack of\necological revolutions and mass-extinction events, these were not caused by the actions of a\nparticular lizard, bat or fungus. Rather, they were caused by the workings of mighty natural forces\nsuch as climate change, tectonic plate movement, volcanic eruptions and asteroid collisions.\nPie chart of global biomass of large animals.\nSome people fear that today we are again in mortal danger of massive volcanic eruptions or\ncolliding asteroids. Hollywood producers make billions out of these anxieties. Yet in reality, the\ndanger is slim. Mass extinctions occur once every many millions of years. Yes, a big asteroid will\nprobably hit our planet sometime in the next 100 million years, but it is very unlikely to happen next\nTuesday. Instead of fearing asteroids, we should fear ourselves.\nFor Homo sapiens has rewritten the rules of the game. This single ape species has managed within\n70,000 years to change the global ecosystem in radical and unprecedented ways. Our impact is\nalready on a par with that of ice ages and tectonic movements. Within a century, our impact may\nsurpass that of the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.\nThat asteroid changed the trajectory of terrestrial evolution, but not its fundamental rules, which\nhave remained fixed since the appearance of the first organisms 4 billion years ago. During all those\naeons, whether you were a virus or a dinosaur, you evolved according to the unchanging principles of\nnatural selection. In addition, no matter what strange and bizarre shapes life adopted, it remained\nconfined to the organic realm \u2013 whether a cactus or a whale, you were made of organic compounds.\nNow humankind is poised to replace natural selection with intelligent design, and to extend life from\nthe organic realm into the inorganic.\nEven if we leave aside these future prospects and only look back on the last 70,000 years, it is\nevident that the Anthropocene has altered the world in unprecedented ways. Asteroids, plate tectonics\nand climate change may have impacted organisms all over the globe, but their influence differed from\none area to another. The planet never constituted a single ecosystem; rather, it was a collection of\nmany loosely connected ecosystems. When tectonic movements joined North America with South\nAmerica it led to the extinction of most South American marsupials, but had no detrimental effect on\nthe Australian kangaroo. When the last ice age reached its peak 20,000 years ago, jellyfish in the\nPersian Gulf and jellyfish in Tokyo Bay both had to adapt to the new climate. Yet since there was no\nconnection between the two populations, each reacted in a different way, evolving in distinct\ndirections.\nIn contrast, Sapiens broke the barriers that had separated the globe into independent ecological\nzones. In the Anthropocene, the planet became for the first time a single ecological unit. Australia,\nEurope and America continued to have different climates and topographies, yet humans caused\norganisms from throughout the world to mingle on a regular basis, irrespective of distance and\ngeography. What began as a trickle of wooden boats has turned into a torrent of aeroplanes, oil\ntankers and giant cargo ships that criss-cross every ocean and bind every island and continent.\nConsequently the ecology of, say, Australia can no longer be understood without taking into account\nthe European mammals or American microorganisms that flood its shores and deserts. Sheep, wheat,\nrats and flu viruses that humans brought to Australia during the last 300 years are today far more\nimportant to its ecology than the native kangaroos and koalas.\nBut the Anthropocene isn\u2019t a novel phenomenon of the last few centuries. Already tens of thousands\nof years ago, when our Stone Age ancestors spread from East Africa to the four corners of the earth,\nthey changed the flora and fauna of every continent and island on which they settled. They drove to\nextinction all the other human species of the world, 90 per cent of the large animals of Australia, 75\nper cent of the large mammals of America and about 50 per cent of all the large land mammals of the\nplanet \u2013 and all before they planted the first wheat field, shaped the first metal tool, wrote the first\ntext or struck the first coin.\n6\nLarge animals were the main victims because they were relatively few, and they bred slowly.\nCompare, for example, mammoths (which became extinct) to rabbits (which survived). A troop of\nmammoths numbered no more than a few dozen individuals, and bred at a rate of perhaps just two\nyoungsters per year. Hence if the local human tribe hunted just three mammoths a year, it would have\nbeen enough for deaths to outstrip births, and within a few generations the mammoths disappeared.\nRabbits, in contrast, bred like rabbits. Even if humans hunted hundreds of rabbits each year, it was not\nenough to drive them to extinction.\nNot that our ancestors planned on wiping out the mammoths; they were simply unaware of the\nconsequences of their actions. The extinction of the mammoths and other large animals may have been\nswift on an evolutionary timescale, but slow and gradual in human terms. People lived no more than\nseventy or eighty years, whereas the extinction process took centuries. The ancient Sapiens probably\nfailed to notice any connection between the annual mammoth hunt \u2013 in which no more than two or\nthree mammoths were killed \u2013 and the disappearance of these furry giants. At most, a nostalgic elder\nmight have told sceptical youngsters that \u2018when I was young, mammoths were much more plentiful\nthan these days. And so were mastodons and giant elks. And, of course, the tribal chiefs were honest,\nand children respected their elders.\u2019\nThe Serpent\u2019s Children\nAnthropological and archaeological evidence indicates that archaic hunter-gatherers were probably\nanimists: they believed that there was no essential gap separating humans from other animals. The\nworld \u2013 i.e. the local valley and the surrounding mountain chains \u2013 belonged to all its inhabitants, and\neveryone followed a common set of rules. These rules involved ceaseless negotiation between all\nconcerned beings. People talked with animals, trees and stones, as well as with fairies, demons and\nghosts. Out of this web of communications emerged the values and norms that were binding on\nhumans, elephants, oak trees and wraiths alike.\n7\nThe animist world view still guides some hunter-gatherer communities that have survived into the\nmodern age. One of them is the Nayaka people, who live in the tropical forests of south India. The\nanthropologist Danny Naveh, who studied the Nayaka for several years, reports that when a Nayaka\nwalking in the jungle encounters a dangerous animal such as a tiger, snake or elephant, he or she might\naddress the animal and say: \u2018You live in the forest. I too live here in the forest. You came here to eat,\nand I too came here to gather roots and tubers. I didn\u2019t come to hurt you.\u2019\nA Nayaka was once killed by a male elephant they called \u2018the elephant who always walks alone\u2019.\nThe Nayakas refused to help officials from the Indian forestry department capture him. They\nexplained to Naveh that this elephant used to be very close to another male elephant, with whom he\nalways roamed. One day the forestry department captured the second elephant, and since then \u2018the\nelephant who always walks alone\u2019 had become angry and violent. \u2018How would you have felt if your\nspouse had been taken away from you? This is exactly how this elephant felt. These two elephants\nsometimes separated at night, each walking its own path . . . but in the morning they always came\ntogether again. On that day, the elephant saw his buddy falling, lying down. If two are always together\nand then you shoot one \u2013 how would the other feel?\u2019\n8\nSuch an animistic attitude strikes many industrialised people as alien. Most of us automatically see\nanimals as essentially different and inferior. This is because even our most ancient traditions were\ncreated thousands of years after the end of the hunter-gatherer era. The Old Testament, for example,\nwas written down in the first millennium BC, and its oldest stories reflect the realities of the second\nmillennium BC. But in the Middle East the age of the hunter-gatherers ended more than 7,000 years\nearlier. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Bible rejects animistic beliefs and its only animistic\nstory appears right at the beginning, as a dire warning. The Bible is a long book, bursting with\nmiracles, wonders and marvels. Yet the only time an animal initiates a conversation with a human is\nwhen the serpent tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge (Bil\u2019am\u2019s donkey also speaks a\nfew words, but she is merely conveying to Bil\u2019am a message from God).\nIn the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve lived as foragers. The expulsion from Eden bears a striking\nresemblance to the Agricultural Revolution. Instead of allowing Adam to keep gathering wild fruits,\nan angry God condemns him \u2018to eat bread by the sweat of your brow\u2019. It might be no coincidence,\nthen, that biblical animals spoke with humans only in the pre-agricultural era of Eden. What lessons\ndoes the Bible draw from the episode? That you shouldn\u2019t listen to snakes, and it is generally best to\navoid talking with animals and plants. It leads to nothing but disaster.\nYet the biblical story has deeper and more ancient layers of meaning. In most Semitic languages,\n\u2018Eve\u2019 means \u2018snake\u2019 or even \u2018female snake\u2019. The name of our ancestral biblical mother hides an\narchaic animist myth, according to which snakes are not our enemies, but our ancestors.\n9 Many\nanimist cultures believed that humans descended from animals, including from snakes and other\nreptiles. Most Australian Aborigines believed that the Rainbow Serpent created the world. The\nAranda and Dieri people maintained that their particular tribes originated from primordial lizards or\nsnakes, which were transformed into humans.\n10\nIn fact, modern Westerners too think that they have\nevolved from reptiles. The brain of each and every one of us is built around a reptilian core, and the\nstructure of our bodies is essentially that of modified reptiles.\nParadise lost (the Sistine Chapel). The serpent \u2013 who sports a human upper body \u2013 initiates the entire chain of events. While the first\ntwo chapters of Genesis are dominated by divine monologues (\u2018and God said . . . and God said . . . and God said . . .\u2019), in the third\nchapter we finally get a dialogue \u2013 between Eve and the serpent (\u2018and the serpent said unto the woman . . . and the woman said unto the\nserpent . . .\u2019). This unique conversation between a human and an animal leads to the fall of humanity and our expulsion from Eden.\nDetail from Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475\u20131564), the Sistine Chapel, Vatican City \u00a9 Lessing Images.\nThe authors of the book of Genesis may have preserved a remnant of archaic animist beliefs in\nEve\u2019s name, but they took great care to conceal all other traces. Genesis says that, instead of\ndescending from snakes, humans were divinely created from inanimate matter. The snake is not our\nprogenitor: he seduces us to rebel against our heavenly Father. While animists saw humans as just\nanother kind of animal, the Bible argues that humans are a unique creation, and any attempt to\nacknowledge the animal within us denies God\u2019s power and authority. Indeed, when modern humans\ndiscovered that they actually evolved from reptiles, they rebelled against God and stopped listening\nto Him \u2013 or even believing in His existence.\nAncestral Needs\nThe Bible, along with its belief in human distinctiveness, was one of the by-products of the\nAgricultural Revolution, which initiated a new phase in human\u2013animal relations. The advent of\nfarming produced new waves of mass extinctions, but more importantly, it created a completely new\nlife form on earth: domesticated animals. Initially this development was of minor importance, since\nhumans managed to domesticate fewer than twenty species of mammals and birds, compared to the\ncountless thousands of species that remained \u2018wild\u2019. Yet with the passing of the centuries, this novel\nlife form became dominant. Today more than 90 per cent of all large animals are domesticated.\nAlas, domesticated species paid for their unparalleled collective success with unprecedented\nindividual suffering. Although the animal kingdom has known many types of pain and misery for\nmillions of years, the Agricultural Revolution generated completely new kinds of suffering, that only\nbecame worse over time.\nTo the casual observer domesticated animals may seem much better off than their wild cousins and\nancestors. Wild boars spend their days searching for food, water and shelter, and are constantly\nthreatened by lions, parasites and floods. Domesticated pigs, in contrast, enjoy food, water and\nshelter provided by humans, who also treat their diseases and protect them against predators and\nnatural disasters. True, most pigs sooner or later find themselves in the slaughterhouse. Yet does that\nmake their fate any worse than the fate of wild boars? Is it better to be devoured by a lion than\nslaughtered by a man? Are crocodile teeth less deadly than steel blades?\nWhat makes the fate of domesticated farm animals particularly harsh is not just the way they die,\nbut above all the way they live. Two competing factors have shaped the living conditions of farm\nanimals from ancient times to the present day: human desires and animal needs. Thus humans raise\npigs in order to get meat, but if they want a steady supply of meat, they must ensure the long-term\nsurvival and reproduction of the pigs. Theoretically this should have protected the animals from\nextreme forms of cruelty. If a farmer did not take good care of his pigs, they would soon die without\noffspring and the farmer would starve.\nUnfortunately, humans can cause tremendous suffering to farm animals in various ways, even while\nensuring their survival and reproduction. The root of the problem is that domesticated animals have\ninherited from their wild ancestors many physical, emotional and social needs that are redundant on\nhuman farms. Farmers routinely ignore these needs, without paying any economic penalty. They lock\nanimals in tiny cages, mutilate their horns and tails, separate mothers from offspring and selectively\nbreed monstrosities. The animals suffer greatly, yet they live on and multiply.\nDoesn\u2019t that contradict the most basic principles of natural selection? The theory of evolution\nmaintains that all instincts, drives and emotions have evolved in the sole interest of survival and\nreproduction. If so, doesn\u2019t the continuous reproduction of farm animals prove that all their real needs\nare met? How can a pig have a \u2018need\u2019 that is not really needed for his survival and reproduction?\nIt is certainly true that all instincts, drives and emotions evolved in order to meet the evolutionary\npressures of survival and reproduction. However, if and when these pressures suddenly disappear,\nthe instincts, drives and emotions they had shaped do not disappear with them. At least not instantly.\nEven if they are no longer instrumental for survival and reproduction, these instincts, drives and\nemotions continue to mould the subjective experiences of the animal. For animals and humans alike,\nagriculture changed selection pressures almost overnight, but it did not change their physical,\nemotional and social drives. Of course evolution never stands still, and it has continued to modify\nhumans and animals in the 12,000 years since the advent of farming. For example, humans in Europe\nand western Asia evolved the ability to digest cows\u2019 milk, while cows lost their fear of humans, and\ntoday produce far more milk than their wild ancestors. Yet these are superficial alterations. The deep\nsensory and emotional structures of cows, pigs and humans alike haven\u2019t changed much since the\nStone Age.\nWhy do modern humans love sweets so much? Not because in the early twenty-first century we\nmust gorge on ice cream and chocolate in order to survive. Rather, it is because when our Stone Age\nancestors came across sweet fruit or honey, the most sensible thing to do was to eat as much of it as\nquickly as possible. Why do young men drive recklessly, get involved in violent arguments and hack\nconfidential Internet sites? Because they are following ancient genetic decrees that might be useless\nand even counterproductive today, but that made good evolutionary sense 70,000 years ago. A young\nhunter who risked his life chasing a mammoth outshone all his competitors and won the hand of the\nlocal beauty; and we are now stuck with his macho genes.\n11\nExactly the same evolutionary logic shapes the lives of pigs, sows and piglets in human-controlled\nfarms. In order to survive and reproduce in the wild, ancient boars needed to roam vast territories,\nfamiliarise themselves with their environment and beware of traps and predators. They further needed\nto communicate and cooperate with their fellow boars, forming complex groups dominated by old and\nexperienced matriarchs. Evolutionary pressures consequently made wild boars \u2013 and even more so\nwild sows \u2013 highly intelligent social animals, characterised by a lively curiosity and strong urges to\nsocialise, play, wander about and explore their surroundings. A sow born with some rare mutation\nthat made her indifferent to her environment and to other boars was unlikely to survive or reproduce.\nThe descendants of wild boars \u2013 domesticated pigs \u2013 inherited their intelligence, curiosity and\nsocial skills.\n12 Like wild boars, domesticated pigs communicate using a rich variety of vocal and\nolfactory signals: mother sows recognise the unique squeaks of their piglets, whereas two-day-old\npiglets already differentiate their mother\u2019s calls from those of other sows.\n13 Professor Stanley Curtis\nof the Pennsylvania State University trained two pigs \u2013 named Hamlet and Omelette \u2013 to control a\nspecial joystick with their snouts, and found that the pigs soon rivalled primates in learning and\nplaying simple computer games.\n14\nToday most sows in industrial farms don\u2019t play computer games. They are locked by their human\nmasters in tiny gestation crates, usually measuring two metres by sixty centimetres. The crates have a\nconcrete floor and metal bars, and hardly allow the pregnant sows even to turn around or sleep on\ntheir side, never mind walk. After three and a half months in such conditions, the sows are moved to\nslightly wider crates, where they give birth and nurse their piglets. Whereas piglets would naturally\nsuckle for ten to twenty weeks, in industrial farms they are forcibly weaned within two to four weeks,\nseparated from their mother and shipped to be fattened and slaughtered. The mother is immediately\nimpregnated again, and sent back to the gestation crate to start another cycle. The typical sow would\ngo through five to ten such cycles before being slaughtered herself. In recent years the use of crates\nhas been restricted in the European Union and some US states, but the crates are still commonly used\nin many other countries, and tens of millions of breeding sows pass almost their entire lives in them.\nThe human farmers take care of everything the sow needs in order to survive and reproduce. She is\ngiven enough food, vaccinated against diseases, protected against the elements and artificially\ninseminated. From an objective perspective, the sow no longer needs to explore her surroundings,\nsocialise with other pigs, bond with her piglets or even walk. But from a subjective perspective, the\nsow still feels very strong urges to do all of these things, and if these urges are not fulfilled she\nsuffers greatly. Sows locked in gestation crates typically display acute frustration alternating with\nextreme despair.\n15\nThis is the basic lesson of evolutionary psychology: a need shaped thousands of generations ago\ncontinues to be felt subjectively even if it is no longer necessary for survival and reproduction in the\npresent. Tragically, the Agricultural Revolution gave humans the power to ensure the survival and\nreproduction of domesticated animals while ignoring their subjective needs.\nSows confined in gestation crates. These highly social and intelligent beings spend most of their lives in this condition, as if they were\nalready sausages.\n\u00a9 Balint Porneczi/Bloomberg via Getty Images.\nOrganisms are Algorithms\nHow can we be sure that animals such as pigs actually have a subjective world of needs, sensations\nand emotions? Aren\u2019t we guilty of humanising animals, i.e. ascribing human qualities to non-human\nentities, like children believing that dolls feel love and anger?\nIn fact, attributing emotions to pigs doesn\u2019t humanise them. It \u2018mammalises\u2019 them. For emotions are\nnot a uniquely human quality \u2013 they are common to all mammals (as well as to all birds and probably\nto some reptiles and even fish). All mammals evolved emotional abilities and needs, and from the\nfact that pigs are mammals we can safely deduce that they have emotions.\n16\nIn recent decades life scientists have demonstrated that emotions are not some mysterious spiritual\nphenomenon that is useful just for writing poetry and composing symphonies. Rather, emotions are\nbiochemical algorithms that are vital for the survival and reproduction of all mammals. What does\nthis mean? Well, let\u2019s begin by explaining what an algorithm is. This is of great importance not only\nbecause this key concept will reappear in many of the following chapters, but also because the\ntwenty-first century will be dominated by algorithms. \u2018Algorithm\u2019 is arguably the single most\nimportant concept in our world. If we want to understand our life and our future, we should make\nevery effort to understand what an algorithm is, and how algorithms are connected with emotions.\nAn algorithm is a methodical set of steps that can be used to make calculations, resolve problems\nand reach decisions. An algorithm isn\u2019t a particular calculation, but the method followed when\nmaking the calculation. For example, if you want to calculate the average between two numbers, you\ncan use a simple algorithm. The algorithm says: \u2018First step: add the two numbers together. Second\nstep: divide the sum by two.\u2019 When you enter the numbers 4 and 8, you get 6. When you enter 117 and\n231, you get 174.\nA more complex example is a cooking recipe. An algorithm for preparing vegetable soup may tell\nus:\n1. Heat half a cup of oil in a pot.\n2. Finely chop four onions.\n3. Fry the onion until golden.\n4. Cut three potatoes into chunks and add to the pot.\n5. Slice a cabbage into strips and add to the pot.\nAnd so forth. You can follow the same algorithm dozens of times, each time using slightly different\nvegetables, and therefore getting a slightly different soup. But the algorithm remains the same.\nA recipe by itself cannot make soup. You need a person to read the recipe and follow the\nprescribed set of steps. But you can build a machine that embodies this algorithm and follows it\nautomatically. Then you just need to provide the machine with water, electricity and vegetables \u2013 and\nit will prepare the soup by itself. There aren\u2019t many soup machines around, but you are probably\nfamiliar with beverage vending machines. Such machines usually have a slot for coins, an opening for\ncups, and rows of buttons. The first row has buttons for coffee, tea and cocoa. The second row is\nmarked: no sugar, one spoon of sugar, two spoons of sugar. The third row indicates milk, soya milk,\nno milk. A man approaches the machine, inserts a coin into the slot and presses the buttons marked\n\u2018tea\u2019, \u2018one sugar\u2019 and \u2018milk\u2019. The machine kicks into action, following a precise set of steps. It drops\na tea bag into a cup, pours boiling water, adds a spoonful of sugar and milk, and ding! A nice cup of\ntea emerges. This is an algorithm.\n17\nOver the last few decades biologists have reached the firm conclusion that the man pressing the\nbuttons and drinking the tea is also an algorithm. A much more complicated algorithm than the vending\nmachine, no doubt, but still an algorithm. Humans are algorithms that produce not cups of tea, but\ncopies of themselves (like a vending machine which, if you press the right combination of buttons,\nproduces another vending machine).\nThe algorithms controlling vending machines work through mechanical gears and electric circuits.\nThe algorithms controlling humans work through sensations, emotions and thoughts. And exactly the\nsame kind of algorithms control pigs, baboons, otters and chickens. Consider, for example, the\nfollowing survival problem: a baboon spots some bananas hanging on a tree, but also notices a lion\nlurking nearby. Should the baboon risk his life for those bananas?\nThis boils down to a mathematical problem of calculating probabilities: the probability that the\nbaboon will die of hunger if he does not eat the bananas, versus the probability that the lion will catch\nthe baboon. In order to solve this problem the baboon needs to take into account a lot of data. How\nfar am I from the bananas? How far away is the lion? How fast can I run? How fast can the lion run?\nIs the lion awake or asleep? Does the lion seem to be hungry or satiated? How many bananas are\nthere? Are they big or small? Green or ripe? In addition to these external data, the baboon must also\nconsider information about conditions within his own body. If he is starving, it makes sense to risk\neverything for those bananas, no matter the odds. In contrast, if he has just eaten, and the bananas are\nmere greed, why take any risks at all?\nIn order to weigh and balance all these variables and probabilities, the baboon requires far more\ncomplicated algorithms than the ones controlling automatic vending machines. The prize for making\ncorrect calculations is correspondingly greater. The prize is the very survival of the baboon. A timid\nbaboon \u2013 one whose algorithms overestimate dangers \u2013 will starve to death, and the genes that shaped\nthese cowardly algorithms will perish with him. A rash baboon \u2013 one whose algorithms\nunderestimate dangers \u2013 will fall prey to the lion, and his reckless genes will also fail to make it to\nthe next generation. These algorithms undergo constant quality control by natural selection. Only\nanimals that calculate probabilities correctly leave offspring behind.\nYet this is all very abstract. How exactly does a baboon calculate probabilities? He certainly\ndoesn\u2019t draw a pencil from behind his ear, a notebook from a back pocket, and start computing\nrunning speeds and energy levels with a calculator. Rather, the baboon\u2019s entire body is the calculator.\nWhat we call sensations and emotions are in fact algorithms. The baboon feels hunger, he feels fear\nand trembling at the sight of the lion, and he feels his mouth watering at the sight of the bananas.\nWithin a split second, he experiences a storm of sensations, emotions and desires, which is nothing\nbut the process of calculation. The result will appear as a feeling: the baboon will suddenly feel his\nspirit rising, his hairs standing on end, his muscles tensing, his chest expanding, and he will inhale a\nbig breath, and \u2018Forward! I can do it! To the bananas!\u2019 Alternatively, he may be overcome by fear, his\nshoulders will droop, his stomach will turn, his legs will give way, and \u2018Mama! A lion! Help!\u2019\nSometimes the probabilities match so evenly that it is hard to decide. This too will manifest itself as a\nfeeling. The baboon will feel confused and indecisive. \u2018Yes . . . No . . . Yes . . . No . . . Damn! I don\u2019t\nknow what to do!\u2019\nIn order to transmit genes to the next generation, it is not enough to solve survival problems.\nAnimals also need to solve reproduction problems too, and this depends on calculating probabilities.\nNatural selection evolved passion and disgust as quick algorithms for evaluating reproduction odds.\nBeauty means \u2018good chances for having successful offspring\u2019. When a woman sees a man and thinks,\n\u2018Wow! He is gorgeous!\u2019 and when a peahen sees a peacock and thinks, \u2018Jesus! What a tail!\u2019 they are\ndoing something similar to the automatic vending machine. As light reflected from the male\u2019s body\nhits their retinas, extremely powerful algorithms honed by millions of years of evolution kick in.\nWithin a few milliseconds the algorithms convert tiny cues in the male\u2019s external appearance into\nreproduction probabilities, and reach the conclusion: \u2018In all likelihood, this is a very healthy and\nfertile male, with excellent genes. If I mate with him, my offspring are also likely to enjoy good health\nand excellent genes.\u2019 Of course, this conclusion is not spelled out in words or numbers, but in the\nfiery itch of sexual attraction. Peahens, and most women, don\u2019t make such calculations with pen and\npaper. They just feel them.\nEven Nobel laureates in economics make only a tiny fraction of their decisions using pen, paper\nand calculator; 99 per cent of our decisions \u2013 including the most important life choices concerning\nspouses, careers and habitats \u2013 are made by the highly refined algorithms we call sensations,\nemotions and desires.\n18\nBecause these algorithms control the lives of all mammals and birds (and probably some reptiles\nand even fish), when humans, baboons and pigs feel fear, similar neurological processes take place in\nsimilar brain areas. It is therefore likely that frightened humans, frightened baboons and frightened\npigs have similar experiences.\n19\nThere are differences too, of course. Pigs don\u2019t seem to experience the extremes of compassion and\ncruelty that characterise Homo sapiens, nor the sense of wonder that overwhelms a human gazing up\nat the infinitude of a starry sky. It is likely that there are also opposite examples, of swinish emotions\nunfamiliar to humans, but I cannot name any, for obvious reasons. However, one core emotion is\napparently shared by all mammals: the mother\u2013infant bond. Indeed, it gives mammals their name. The\nword \u2018mammal\u2019 comes from the Latin mamma, meaning breast. Mammal mothers love their offspring\nso much that they allow them to suckle from their body. Mammal youngsters, on their side, feel an\noverwhelming desire to bond with their mothers and stay near them. In the wild, piglets, calves and\npuppies that fail to bond with their mothers rarely survive for long. Until recently that was true of\nhuman children too. Conversely, a sow, cow or bitch that due to some rare mutation does not care\nabout her young may live a long and comfortable life, but her genes will not pass to the next\ngeneration. The same logic is true among giraffes, bats, whales and porcupines. We can argue about\nother emotions, but since mammal youngsters cannot survive without motherly care, it is evident that\nmotherly love and a strong mother\u2013infant bond characterise all mammals.\n20\nA peacock and a man. When you look at these images, data on proportions, colours and sizes gets processed by your biochemical\nalgorithms, causing you to feel attraction, repulsion or indifference.\nLeft: \u00a9 Bergserg/Shutterstock.com. Right: \u00a9 s_bukley/Shutterstock.com.\nIt took scientists many years to acknowledge this. Not long ago psychologists doubted the\nimportance of the emotional bond between parents and children even among humans. In the first half\nof the twentieth century, and despite the influence of Freudian theories, the dominant behaviourist\nschool argued that relations between parents and children were shaped by material feedback; that\nchildren needed mainly food, shelter and medical care; and that children bonded with their parents\nsimply because the latter provide these material needs. Children who demanded warmth, hugs and\nkisses were thought to be \u2018spoiled\u2019. Childcare experts warned that children who were hugged and\nkissed by their parents would grow up to be needy, egotistical and insecure adults.\n21\nJohn Watson, a leading childcare authority in the 1920s, sternly advised parents, \u2018Never hug and\nkiss [your children], never let them sit in your lap. If you must, kiss them once on the forehead when\nthey say goodnight. Shake hands with them in the morning.\u2019\n22 The popular magazine Infant Care\nexplained that the secret of raising children is to maintain discipline and to provide the children\u2019s\nmaterial needs according to a strict daily schedule. A 1929 article instructed parents that if an infant\ncries out for food before the normal feeding time, \u2018Do not hold him, nor rock him to stop his crying,\nand do not nurse him until the exact hour for the feeding comes. It will not hurt the baby, even the tiny\nbaby, to cry.\u2019\n23\nOnly in the 1950s and 1960s did a growing consensus of experts abandon these strict behaviourist\ntheories and acknowledge the central importance of emotional needs. In a series of famous (and\nshockingly cruel) experiments, the psychologist Harry Harlow separated infant monkeys from their\nmothers shortly after birth, and isolated them in small cages. When given a choice between a metal\ndummy-mother fitted with a milk bottle, and a soft cloth-covered dummy with no milk, the baby\nmonkeys clung to the barren cloth mother for all they were worth.\nThose baby monkeys knew something that John Watson and the experts of Infant Care failed to\nrealise: mammals can\u2019t live on food alone. They need emotional bonds too. Millions of years of\nevolution preprogrammed the monkeys with an overwhelming desire for emotional bonding.\nEvolution also imprinted them with the assumption that emotional bonds are more likely to be formed\nwith soft furry things than with hard and metallic objects. (This is also why small human children are\nfar more likely to become attached to dolls, blankets and smelly rags than to cutlery, stones or\nwooden blocks.) The need for emotional bonds is so strong that Harlow\u2019s baby monkeys abandoned\nthe nourishing metal dummy and turned their attention to the only object that seemed capable of\nanswering that need. Alas, the cloth-mother never responded to their affection and the little monkeys\nconsequently suffered from severe psychological and social problems, and grew up to be neurotic and\nasocial adults.\nToday we look back with incomprehension at early twentieth-century child-rearing advice. How\ncould experts fail to appreciate that children have emotional needs, and that their mental and physical\nhealth depends as much on providing for these needs as on food, shelter and medicines? Yet when it\ncomes to other mammals we keep denying the obvious. Like John Watson and the Infant Care experts,\nfarmers throughout history took care of the material needs of piglets, calves and kids, but tended to\nignore their emotional needs. Thus both the meat and dairy industries are based on breaking the most\nfundamental emotional bond in the mammal kingdom. Farmers get their breeding sows and dairy cows\nimpregnated again and again. Yet the piglets and calves are separated from their mothers shortly after\nbirth, and often pass their days without ever sucking at her teats or feeling the warm touch of her\ntongue and body. What Harry Harlow did to a few hundred monkeys, the meat and dairy industries are\ndoing to billions of animals every year.\n24\nThe Agricultural Deal\nHow did farmers justify their behaviour? Whereas hunter-gatherers were seldom aware of the\ndamage they inflicted on the ecosystem, farmers knew perfectly well what they were doing. They\nknew they were exploiting domesticated animals and subjugating them to human desires and whims.\nThey justified their actions in the name of new theist religions, which mushroomed and spread in the\nwake of the Agricultural Revolution. Theist religions maintained that the universe is ruled by a group\nof great gods \u2013 or perhaps by a single capital \u2018G\u2019 God. We don\u2019t normally associate this idea with\nagriculture, but at least in their beginnings theist religions were an agricultural enterprise. The\ntheology, mythology and liturgy of religions such as Judaism, Hinduism and Christianity revolved at\nfirst around the relationship between humans, domesticated plants and farm animals.\n25\nBiblical Judaism, for instance, catered to peasants and shepherds. Most of its commandments dealt\nwith farming and village life, and its major holidays were harvest festivals. People today imagine the\nancient temple in Jerusalem as a kind of big synagogue where priests clad in snow-white robes\nwelcomed devout pilgrims, melodious choirs sang psalms and incense perfumed the air. In reality, it\nlooked much more like a cross between a slaughterhouse and a barbecue joint than a modern\nsynagogue. The pilgrims did not come empty-handed. They brought with them a never-ending stream\nof sheep, goats, chickens and other animals, which were sacrificed at the god\u2019s altar and then cooked\nand eaten. The psalm-singing choirs could hardly be heard over the bellowing and bleating of calves\nand kids. Priests in bloodstained outfits cut the victims\u2019 throats, collected the gushing blood in jars\nand spilled it over the altar. The perfume of incense mixed with the odours of congealed blood and\nroasted meat, while swarms of black flies buzzed just about everywhere (see, for example, Numbers\n28, Deuteronomy 12, and 1 Samuel 2). A modern Jewish family that celebrates a holiday by having a\nbarbecue on their front lawn is much closer to the spirit of biblical times than an orthodox family that\nspends the time studying scriptures in a synagogue.\nTheist religions, such as biblical Judaism, justified the agricultural economy through new\ncosmological myths. Animist religions had previously depicted the universe as a grand Chinese opera\nwith a limitless cast of colourful actors. Elephants and oak trees, crocodiles and rivers, mountains\nand frogs, ghosts and fairies, angels and demons \u2013 each had a role in the cosmic opera. Theist\nreligions rewrote the script, turning the universe into a bleak Ibsen drama with just two main\ncharacters: man and God. The angels and demons somehow survived the transition, becoming the\nmessengers and servants of the great gods. Yet the rest of the animist cast \u2013 all the animals, plants and\nother natural phenomena \u2013 were transformed into silent decor. True, some animals were considered\nsacred to this or that god, and many gods had animal features: the Egyptian god Anubis had the head\nof a jackal, and even Jesus Christ was frequently depicted as a lamb. Yet ancient Egyptians could\neasily tell the difference between Anubis and an ordinary jackal sneaking into the village to hunt\nchickens, and no Christian butcher ever mistook the lamb under his knife for Jesus.\nWe normally think that theist religions sanctified the great gods. We tend to forget that they\nsanctified humans, too. Hitherto Homo sapiens had been just one actor in a cast of thousands. In the\nnew theist drama, Sapiens became the central hero around whom the entire universe revolved.\nThe gods, meanwhile, were given two related roles to play. Firstly, they explained what is so\nspecial about Sapiens and why humans should dominate and exploit all other organisms. Christianity,\nfor example, maintained that humans hold sway over the rest of creation because the Creator charged\nthem with that authority. Moreover, according to Christianity, God gave an eternal soul only to\nhumans. Since the fate of this eternal soul is the point of the whole Christian cosmos, and since\nanimals have no soul, they are mere extras. Humans thus became the apex of creation, while all other\norganisms were pushed to the sidelines.\nSecondly, the gods had to mediate between humans and the ecosystem. In the animistic cosmos,\neveryone talked with everyone directly. If you needed something from the caribou, the fig trees, the\nclouds or the rocks, you addressed them yourself. In the theist cosmos, all non-human entities were\nsilenced. Consequently you could no longer talk with trees and animals. What to do, then, when you\nwanted the trees to give more fruits, the cows to give more milk, the clouds to bring more rain and the\nlocusts to stay away from your crops? That\u2019s where the gods entered the picture. They promised to\nsupply rain, fertility and protection, provided humans did something in return. This was the essence of\nthe agricultural deal. The gods safeguarded and multiplied farm production, and in exchange humans\nhad to share the produce with the gods. This deal served both parties, at the expense of the rest of the\necosystem.\nToday in Nepal, devotees of the goddess Gadhimai celebrate her festival every five years in the\nvillage of Bariyapur. A record was set in 2009 when 250,000 animals were sacrificed to the goddess.\nA local driver explained to a visiting British journalist that \u2018If we want anything, and we come here\nwith an offering to the goddess, within five years all our dreams will be fulfilled.\u2019\n26\nMuch of theist mythology explains the subtle details of this deal. The Mesopotamian Gilgamesh\nepic recounts that when the gods sent a great deluge to destroy the world, almost all humans and\nanimals perished. Only then did the rash gods realise that nobody remained to make any offerings to\nthem. They became crazed with hunger and distress. Luckily, one human family survived, thanks to the\nforesight of the god Enki, who instructed his devotee Utnapishtim to take shelter in a large wooden\nark along with his relatives and a menagerie of animals. When the deluge subsided and this\nMesopotamian Noah emerged from his ark, the first thing he did was sacrifice some animals to the\ngods. Then, tells the epic, all the great gods rushed to the spot: \u2018The gods smelled the savour / the\ngods smelled the sweet savour / the gods swarmed like flies around the offering.\u2019\n27 The biblical story\nof the deluge (written more than 1,000 years after the Mesopotamian version) also reports that\nimmediately upon leaving the ark, \u2018Noah built an altar to the Lord and, taking some of the clean\nanimals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it. The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and\nsaid in his heart: Never again will I curse the ground because of humans\u2019 (Genesis 8:20\u20131).\nThis deluge story became a founding myth of the agricultural world. It is possible of course to give\nit a modern environmentalist spin. The deluge could teach us that our actions can ruin the entire\necosystem, and humans are divinely charged with protecting the rest of creation. Yet traditional\ninterpretations saw the deluge as proof of human supremacy and animal worthlessness. According to\nthese interpretations, Noah was instructed to save the whole ecosystem in order to protect the\ncommon interests of gods and humans rather than the interests of the animals. Non-human organisms\nhave no intrinsic value, and exist solely for our sake.\nAfter all, when \u2018the Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become\u2019 He\nresolved to \u2018wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created \u2013 and with them the\nanimals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground \u2013 for I regret that I have made them\u2019\n(Genesis 6:7). The Bible thinks it is perfectly all right to destroy all animals as punishment for the\ncrimes of Homo sapiens, as if the existence of giraffes, pelicans and ladybirds has lost all purpose if\nhumans misbehave. The Bible could not imagine a scenario in which God repents having created\nHomo sapiens, wipes this sinful ape off the face of the earth, and then spends eternity enjoying the\nantics of ostriches, kangaroos and panda bears.\nTheist religions nevertheless have certain animal-friendly beliefs. The gods gave humans authority\nover the animal kingdom, but this authority carried with it some responsibilities. For example, Jews\nwere commanded to allow farm animals to rest on the Sabbath, and whenever possible to avoid\ncausing them unnecessary suffering. (Though whenever interests clashed, human interests always\ntrumped animal interests.\n28\n)\nA Talmudic tale recounts how on the way to the slaughterhouse, a calf escaped and sought refuge\nwith Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, one of the founders of rabbinical Judaism. The calf tucked his head under\nthe rabbi\u2019s flowing robes and started crying. Yet the rabbi pushed the calf away, saying, \u2018Go. You\nwere created for that very purpose.\u2019 Since the rabbi showed no mercy, God punished him, and he\nsuffered from a painful illness for thirteen years. Then, one day, a servant cleaning the rabbi\u2019s house\nfound some newborn rats and began sweeping them out. Rabbi Yehuda rushed to save the helpless\ncreatures, instructing the servant to leave them in peace, because \u2018God is good to all, and has\ncompassion on all he has made\u2019 (Psalms 145:9). Since the rabbi showed compassion to these rats,\nGod showed compassion to the rabbi, and he was cured of his illness.\n29\nOther religions, particularly Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, have demonstrated even greater\nempathy to animals. They emphasise the connection between humans and the rest of the ecosystem,\nand their foremost ethical commandment has been to avoid killing any living being. Whereas the\nbiblical \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019 covered only humans, the ancient Indian principle of ahimsa (nonviolence) extends to every sentient being. Jain monks are particularly careful in this regard. They\nalways cover their mouths with a white cloth, lest they inhale an insect, and whenever they walk they\ncarry a broom to gently sweep any ant or beetle from their path.\n30\nNevertheless, all agricultural religions \u2013 Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism included \u2013 found ways\nto justify human superiority and the exploitation of animals (if not for meat, then for milk and muscle\npower). They have all claimed that a natural hierarchy of beings entitles humans to control and use\nother animals, provided that the humans observe certain restrictions. Hinduism, for example, has\nsanctified cows and forbidden eating beef, but has also provided the ultimate justification for the\ndairy industry, alleging that cows are generous creatures, and positively yearn to share their milk with\nhumankind.\nHumans thus committed themselves to an \u2018agricultural deal\u2019. According to this deal, cosmic forces\ngave humans command over other animals, on condition that humans fulfilled certain obligations\ntowards the gods, towards nature and towards the animals themselves. It was easy to believe in the\nexistence of such a cosmic compact, because it reflected the daily routine of farming life.\nHunter-gatherers had not seen themselves as superior beings because they were seldom aware of\ntheir impact on the ecosystem. A typical band numbered in the dozens, it was surrounded by thousands\nof wild animals, and its survival depended on understanding and respecting the desires of these\nanimals. Foragers had to constantly ask themselves what deer dream about, and what lions think.\nOtherwise, they could not hunt the deer, nor escape the lions.\nFarmers, in contrast, lived in a world controlled and shaped by human dreams and thoughts.\nHumans were still subject to formidable natural forces such as storms and earthquakes, but they were\nfar less dependent on the wishes of other animals. A farm boy learned early on to ride a horse,\nharness a bull, whip a stubborn donkey and lead the sheep to pasture. It was easy and tempting to\nbelieve that such everyday activities reflected either the natural order of things or the will of heaven.\nIt is no coincidence that the Nayaka of southern India treat elephants, snakes and forest trees as\nbeings equal to humans, but have a very different view of domesticated plants and animals. In the\nNayaka language a living being possessing a unique personality is called mansan. When probed by\nthe anthropologist Danny Naveh, they explained that all elephants are mansan. \u2018We live in the forest,\nthey live in the forest. We are all mansan . . . So are bears, deer and tigers. All forest animals.\u2019 What\nabout cows? \u2018Cows are different. You have to lead them everywhere.\u2019 And chickens? \u2018They are\nnothing. They are not mansan.\u2019 And forest trees? \u2018Yes \u2013 they live for such a long time.\u2019 And tea\nbushes? \u2018Oh, these I cultivate so that I can sell the tea leaves and buy what I need from the store. No,\nthey aren\u2019t mansan.\u2019\n31\nWe should also bear in mind how humans themselves were treated in most agricultural societies. In\nbiblical Israel or medieval China it was common to whip humans, enslave them, torture and execute\nthem. Humans were considered as mere property. Rulers did not dream of asking peasants for their\nopinions and cared little about their needs. Parents frequently sold their children into slavery, or\nmarried them off to the highest bidder. Under such conditions, ignoring the feelings of cows and\nchickens was hardly surprising.\nFive Hundred Years of Solitude\nThe rise of modern science and industry brought about the next revolution in human\u2013animal relations.\nDuring the Agricultural Revolution humankind silenced animals and plants, and turned the animist\ngrand opera into a dialogue between man and gods. During the Scientific Revolution humankind\nsilenced the gods too. The world was now a one-man show. Humankind stood alone on an empty\nstage, talking to itself, negotiating with no one and acquiring enormous powers without any\nobligations. Having deciphered the mute laws of physics, chemistry and biology, humankind now\ndoes with them as it pleases.\nWhen an archaic hunter went out to the savannah, he asked the help of the wild bull, and the bull\ndemanded something of the hunter. When an ancient farmer wanted his cows to produce lots of milk,\nhe asked some great heavenly god for help, and the god stipulated his conditions. When the whitecoated staff in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Research and Development department want to increase dairy production,\nthey study genetics \u2013 and the genes don\u2019t ask for anything in return.\nBut just as the hunters and farmers had their myths, so do the people in the R&D department. Their\nmost famous myth shamelessly plagiarises the legend of the Tree of Knowledge and the Garden of\nEden, but transports the action to the garden at Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire. According to this\nmyth, Isaac Newton was sitting there under an apple tree when a ripe apple dropped on his head.\nNewton began wondering why the apple fell straight downwards, rather than sideways or upwards.\nHis enquiry led him to discover gravity and the laws of Newtonian mechanics.\nNewton\u2019s story turns the Tree of Knowledge myth on its head. In the Garden of Eden the serpent\ninitiates the drama, tempting humans to sin, thereby bringing the wrath of God down upon them. Adam\nand Eve are a plaything for serpent and God alike. In contrast, in the Garden of Woolsthorpe man is\nthe sole agent. Though Newton himself was a deeply religious Christian who devoted far more time\nto studying the Bible than the laws of physics, the Scientific Revolution that he helped launch pushed\nGod to the sidelines. When Newton\u2019s successors came to write their Genesis myth, they had no use\nfor either God or serpent. The Garden of Woolsthorpe is run by blind laws of nature, and the initiative\nto decipher these laws is strictly human. The story may begin with an apple falling on Newton\u2019s head,\nbut the apple did not do it on purpose.\nIn the Garden of Eden myth, humans are punished for their curiosity and for their wish to gain\nknowledge. God expels them from Paradise. In the Garden of Woolsthorpe myth, nobody punishes\nNewton \u2013 just the opposite. Thanks to his curiosity humankind gains a better understanding of the\nuniverse, becomes more powerful and takes another step towards the technological paradise. Untold\nnumbers of teachers throughout the world recount the Newton myth to encourage curiosity, implying\nthat if only we gain enough knowledge, we can create paradise here on earth.\nIn fact, God is present even in the Newton myth: Newton himself is God. When biotechnology,\nnanotechnology and the other fruits of science ripen, Homo sapiens will attain divine powers and\ncome full circle back to the biblical Tree of Knowledge. Archaic hunter-gatherers were just another\nspecies of animal. Farmers saw themselves as the apex of creation. Scientists will upgrade us into\ngods.\nWhereas the Agricultural Revolution gave rise to theist religions, the Scientific Revolution gave birth\nto humanist religions, in which humans replaced gods. While theists worship theos (Greek for \u2018god\u2019),\nhumanists worship humans. The founding idea of humanist religions such as liberalism, communism\nand Nazism is that Homo sapiens has some unique and sacred essence that is the source of all\nmeaning and authority in the universe. Everything that happens in the cosmos is judged to be good or\nbad according to its impact on Homo sapiens.\nWhereas theism justified traditional agriculture in the name of God, humanism has justified modern\nindustrial farming in the name of Man. Industrial farming sanctifies human needs, whims and wishes,\nwhile disregarding everything else. Industrial farming has no real interest in animals, which don\u2019t\nshare the sanctity of human nature. And it has no use for gods, because modern science and technology\ngive humans powers that far exceed those of the ancient gods. Science enables modern firms to\nsubjugate cows, pigs and chickens to more extreme conditions than those prevailing in traditional\nagricultural societies.\nIn ancient Egypt, in the Roman Empire or in medieval China, humans had only a rudimental\nunderstanding of biochemistry, genetics, zoology and epidemiology. Consequently, their powers of\nmanipulation were limited. In those days, pigs, cows and chickens ran free among the houses, and\nsearched for edible treasures in the rubbish heap and in the nearby woods. If an ambitious peasant\nhad tried to confine thousands of animals in a crowded coop, a deadly epidemic would probably have\nresulted, wiping out all the animals as well as many of the villagers. No priest, shaman or god could\nhave prevented it.\nBut once modern science deciphered the secrets of epidemics, pathogens and antibiotics, industrial\ncoops, pens and pigsties became feasible. With the help of vaccinations, medications, hormones,\npesticides, central air-conditioning systems and automatic feeders, it is now possible to pack tens of\nthousands of pigs, cows or chickens into neat rows of cramped cages, and produce meat, milk and\neggs with unprecedented efficiency.\nIn recent years, as people began to rethink human\u2013animal relations, such practices have come under\nincreasing criticism. We are suddenly showing unprecedented interest in the fate of so-called lower\nlife forms, perhaps because we are about to become one. If and when computer programs attain\nsuperhuman intelligence and unprecedented power, should we begin valuing these programs more\nthan we value humans? Would it be okay, for example, for an artificial intelligence to exploit humans\nand even kill them to further its own needs and desires? If it should never be allowed to do that,\ndespite its superior intelligence and power, why is it ethical for humans to exploit and kill pigs? Do\nhumans have some magical spark, in addition to higher intelligence and greater power, which\ndistinguishes them from pigs, chickens, chimpanzees and computer programs alike? If yes, where did\nthat spark come from, and why are we certain that an AI could never acquire it? If there is no such\nspark, would there be any reason to continue assigning special value to human life even after\ncomputers surpass humans in intelligence and power? Indeed, what exactly is it about humans that\nmake us so intelligent and powerful in the first place, and how likely is it that non-human entities will\never rival and surpass us?\nThe next chapter will examine the nature and power of Homo sapiens, not only in order to\ncomprehend further our relations with other animals, but also to appreciate what the future might hold\nfor us, and what relations between humans and superhumans might look like.\n3\nThe Human Spark\nThere is no doubt that Homo sapiens is the most powerful species in the world. Homo sapiens also\nlikes to think that it enjoys a superior moral status, and that human life has much greater value than the\nlives of pigs, elephants or wolves. This is less obvious. Does might make right? Is human life more\nprecious than porcine life simply because the human collective is more powerful than the pig\ncollective? The United States is far mightier than Afghanistan; does this imply that American lives\nhave greater intrinsic value than Afghan lives?\nIn practice, American lives are more valued. Far more money is invested in the education, health\nand safety of the average American than of the average Afghan. Killing an American citizen creates a\nfar greater international outcry than killing an Afghan citizen. Yet it is generally accepted that this is\nno more than an unjust result of the geopolitical balance of power. Afghanistan may have far less\nclout than the USA, yet the life of a child in the mountains of Tora Bora is considered every bit as\nsacred as the life of a child in Beverly Hills.\nIn contrast, when we privilege human children over piglets, we want to believe that this reflects\nsomething deeper than the ecological balance of power. We want to believe that human lives really\nare superior in some fundamental way. We Sapiens love telling ourselves that we enjoy some magical\nquality that not only accounts for our immense power, but also gives moral justification for our\nprivileged status. What is this unique human spark?\nThe traditional monotheist answer is that only Sapiens have eternal souls. Whereas the body\ndecays and rots, the soul journeys on towards salvation or damnation, and will experience either\neverlasting joy in paradise or an eternity of misery in hell. Since pigs and other animals have no soul,\nthey don\u2019t take part in this cosmic drama. They live only for a few years, and then die and fade into\nnothingness. We should therefore care far more about eternal human souls than about ephemeral pigs.\nThis is no kindergarten fairy tale, but an extremely powerful myth that continues to shape the lives\nof billions of humans and animals in the early twenty-first century. The belief that humans have eternal\nsouls whereas animals are just evanescent bodies is a central pillar of our legal, political and\neconomic system. It explains why, for example, it is perfectly okay for humans to kill animals for\nfood, or even just for the fun of it.\nHowever, our latest scientific discoveries flatly contradict this monotheist myth. True, laboratory\nexperiments confirm the accuracy of one part of the myth: just as monotheist religions say, animals\nhave no souls. All the careful studies and painstaking examinations have failed to discover any trace\nof a soul in pigs, rats or rhesus monkeys. Alas, the same laboratory experiments undermine the second\nand far more important part of the monotheist myth, namely, that humans do have a soul. Scientists\nhave subjected Homo sapiens to tens of thousands of bizarre experiments, and looked into every nook\nin our hearts and every cranny in our brains. But they have so far discovered no magical spark. There\nis zero scientific evidence that in contrast to pigs, Sapiens have souls.\nIf that were all, we could well argue that scientists just need to keep looking. If they haven\u2019t found\nthe soul yet, it is because they haven\u2019t looked carefully enough. Yet the life sciences doubt the\nexistence of soul not just due to lack of evidence, but rather because the very idea of soul contradicts\nthe most fundamental principles of evolution. This contradiction is responsible for the unbridled\nhatred that the theory of evolution inspires among devout monotheists.\nWho\u2019s Afraid of Charles Darwin?\nAccording to a 2012 Gallup survey, only 15 per cent of Americans think that Homo sapiens evolved\nthrough natural selection alone, free of all divine intervention; 32 per cent maintain that humans may\nhave evolved from earlier life forms in a process lasting millions of years, but God orchestrated this\nentire show; 46 per cent believe that God created humans in their current form sometime during the\nlast 10,000 years, just as the Bible says. Spending three years in college has absolutely no impact on\nthese views. The same survey found that among BA graduates, 46 per cent believe in the biblical\ncreation story, whereas only 14 per cent think that humans evolved without any divine supervision.\nEven among holders of MA and PhD degrees, 25 per cent believe the Bible, whereas only 29 per cent\ncredit natural selection alone with the creation of our species.\n1\nThough schools evidently do a very poor job teaching evolution, religious zealots still insist that it\nshould not be taught at all. Alternatively, they demand that children must also be taught the theory of\nintelligent design, according to which all organisms were created by the design of some higher\nintelligence (aka God). \u2018Teach them both theories,\u2019 say the zealots, \u2018and let the kids decide for\nthemselves.\u2019\nWhy does the theory of evolution provoke such objections, whereas nobody seems to care about\nthe theory of relativity or quantum mechanics? How come politicians don\u2019t ask that kids be exposed\nto alternative theories about matter, energy, space and time? After all, Darwin\u2019s ideas seem at first\nsight far less threatening than the monstrosities of Einstein and Werner Heisenberg. The theory of\nevolution rests on the principle of the survival of the fittest, which is a clear and simple \u2013 not to say\nhumdrum \u2013 idea. In contrast, the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics argue that you can twist\ntime and space, that something can appear out of nothing, and that a cat can be both alive and dead at\nthe same time. This makes a mockery of our common sense, yet nobody seeks to protect innocent\nschoolchildren from these scandalous ideas. Why?\nThe theory of relativity makes nobody angry, because it doesn\u2019t contradict any of our cherished\nbeliefs. Most people don\u2019t care an iota whether space and time are absolute or relative. If you think it\nis possible to bend space and time, well, be my guest. Go ahead and bend them. What do I care? In\ncontrast, Darwin has deprived us of our souls. If you really understand the theory of evolution, you\nunderstand that there is no soul. This is a terrifying thought not only to devout Christians and Muslims,\nbut also to many secular people who don\u2019t hold any clear religious dogma, but nevertheless want to\nbelieve that each human possesses an eternal individual essence that remains unchanged throughout\nlife, and can survive even death intact.\nThe literal meaning of the word \u2018individual\u2019 is \u2018something that cannot be divided\u2019. That I am an\n\u2018in-dividual\u2019 implies that my true self is a holistic entity rather than an assemblage of separate parts.\nThis indivisible essence allegedly endures from one moment to the next without losing or absorbing\nanything. My body and brain undergo a constant process of change, as neurons fire, hormones flow\nand muscles contract. My personality, wishes and relationships never stand still, and may be\ncompletely transformed over years and decades. But underneath it all I remain the same person from\nbirth to death \u2013 and hopefully beyond death as well.\nUnfortunately, the theory of evolution rejects the idea that my true self is some indivisible,\nimmutable and potentially eternal essence. According to the theory of evolution, all biological entities\n\u2013 from elephants and oak trees to cells and DNA molecules \u2013 are composed of smaller and simpler\nparts that ceaselessly combine and separate. Elephants and cells have evolved gradually, as a result\nof new combinations and splits. Something that cannot be divided or changed cannot have come into\nexistence through natural selection.\nThe human eye, for example, is an extremely complex system made of numerous smaller parts such\nas the lens, the cornea and the retina. The eye did not pop out of nowhere complete with all these\ncomponents. Rather, it evolved step by tiny step through millions of years. Our eye is very similar to\nthe eye of Homo erectus, who lived 1 million years ago. It is somewhat less similar to the eye of\nAustralopithecus, who lived 5 million years ago. It is very different from the eye of Dryolestes, who\nlived 150 million years ago. And it seems to have nothing in common with the unicellular organisms\nthat inhabited our planet hundreds of millions of years ago.\nYet even unicellular organisms have tiny organelles that enable the microorganism to distinguish\nlight from darkness, and move towards one or the other. The path leading from such archaic sensors to\nthe human eye is long and winding, but if you have hundreds of millions of years to spare, you can\ncertainly cover the entire path, step by step. You can do that because the eye is composed of many\ndifferent parts. If every few generations a small mutation slightly changes one of these parts \u2013 say, the\ncornea becomes a bit more curved \u2013 after millions of generations these changes can result in a human\neye. If the eye were a holistic entity, devoid of any parts, it could never have evolved by natural\nselection.\nThat\u2019s why the theory of evolution cannot accept the idea of souls, at least if by \u2018soul\u2019 we mean\nsomething indivisible, immutable and potentially eternal. Such an entity cannot possibly result from a\nstep-by-step evolution. Natural selection could produce a human eye, because the eye has parts. But\nthe soul has no parts. If the Sapiens soul evolved step by step from the Erectus soul, what exactly\nwere these steps? Is there some part of the soul that is more developed in Sapiens than in Erectus?\nBut the soul has no parts.\nYou might argue that human souls did not evolve, but appeared one bright day in the fullness of\ntheir glory. But when exactly was that bright day? When we look closely at the evolution of\nhumankind, it is embarrassingly difficult to find it. Every human that ever existed came into being as a\nresult of male sperm inseminating a female egg. Think of the first baby to possess a soul. That baby\nwas very similar to her mother and father, except that she had a soul and they didn\u2019t. Our biological\nknowledge can certainly explain the birth of a baby whose cornea was a bit more curved than her\nparents\u2019 corneas. A slight mutation in a single gene can account for that. But biology cannot explain\nthe birth of a baby possessing an eternal soul from parents who did not have even a shred of a soul. Is\na single mutation, or even several mutations, enough to give an animal an essence secure against all\nchanges, including even death?\nHence the existence of souls cannot be squared with the theory of evolution. Evolution means\nchange, and is incapable of producing everlasting entities. From an evolutionary perspective, the\nclosest thing we have to a human essence is our DNA, and the DNA molecule is the vehicle of\nmutation rather than the seat of eternity. This terrifies large numbers of people, who prefer to reject\nthe theory of evolution rather than give up their souls.\nWhy the Stock Exchange Has No Consciousness\nAnother story employed to justify human superiority says that of all the animals on earth, only Homo\nsapiens has a conscious mind. Mind is something very different from soul. The mind isn\u2019t some\nmystical eternal entity. Nor is it an organ such as the eye or the brain. Rather, the mind is a flow of\nsubjective experiences, such as pain, pleasure, anger and love. These mental experiences are made of\ninterlinked sensations, emotions and thoughts, which flash for a brief moment, and immediately\ndisappear. Then other experiences flicker and vanish, arising for an instant and passing away. (When\nreflecting on it, we often try to sort the experiences into distinct categories such as sensations,\nemotions and thoughts, but in actuality they are all mingled together.) This frenzied collection of\nexperiences constitutes the stream of consciousness. Unlike the everlasting soul, the mind has many\nparts, it constantly changes, and there is no reason to think it is eternal.\nThe soul is a story that some people accept while others reject. The stream of consciousness, in\ncontrast, is the concrete reality we directly witness every moment. It is the surest thing in the world.\nYou cannot doubt its existence. Even when we are consumed by doubt and ask ourselves: \u2018Do\nsubjective experiences really exist?\u2019 we can be certain that we are experiencing doubt.\nWhat exactly are the conscious experiences that constitute the flow of the mind? Every subjective\nexperience has two fundamental characteristics: sensation and desire. Robots and computers have no\nconsciousness because despite their myriad abilities they feel nothing and crave nothing. A robot may\nhave an energy sensor that signals to its central processing unit when the battery is about to run out.\nThe robot may then move towards an electrical socket, plug itself in and recharge its battery.\nHowever, throughout this process the robot doesn\u2019t experience anything. In contrast, a human being\ndepleted of energy feels hunger and craves to stop this unpleasant sensation. That\u2019s why we say that\nhumans are conscious beings and robots aren\u2019t, and why it is a crime to make people work until they\ncollapse from hunger and exhaustion, whereas making robots work until their batteries run out carries\nno moral opprobrium.\nAnd what about animals? Are they conscious? Do they have subjective experiences? Is it okay to\nforce a horse to work until he collapses from exhaustion? As noted earlier, the life sciences currently\nargue that all mammals and birds, and at least some reptiles and fish, have sensations and emotions.\nHowever, the most up-to-date theories also maintain that sensations and emotions are biochemical\ndata-processing algorithms. Since we know that robots and computers process data without having\nany subjective experiences, maybe it works the same with animals? Indeed, we know that even in\nhumans many sensory and emotional brain circuits can process data and initiate actions completely\nunconsciously. So perhaps behind all the sensations and emotions we ascribe to animals \u2013 hunger,\nfear, love and loyalty \u2013 lurk only unconscious algorithms rather than subjective experiences?\n2\nThis theory was upheld by the father of modern philosophy, Ren\u00e9 Descartes. In the seventeenth\ncentury Descartes maintained that only humans feel and crave, whereas all other animals are mindless\nautomata, akin to a robot or a vending machine. When a man kicks a dog, the dog experiences nothing.\nThe dog flinches and howls automatically, just like a humming vending machine that makes a cup of\ncoffee without feeling or wanting anything.\nThis theory was widely accepted in Descartes\u2019 day. Seventeenth-century doctors and scholars\ndissected live dogs and observed the working of their internal organs, without either anaesthetics or\nscruples. They didn\u2019t see anything wrong with that, just as we don\u2019t see anything wrong in opening the\nlid of a vending machine and observing its gears and conveyors. In the early twenty-first century there\nare still plenty of people who argue that animals have no consciousness, or at most, that they have a\nvery different and inferior type of consciousness.\nIn order to decide whether animals have conscious minds similar to our own, we must first get a\nbetter understanding of how minds function, and what role they play. These are extremely difficult\nquestions, but it is worthwhile to devote some time to them, because the mind will be the hero of\nseveral subsequent chapters. We won\u2019t be able to grasp the full implications of novel technologies\nsuch as artificial intelligence if we don\u2019t know what minds are. Hence let\u2019s leave aside for a moment\nthe particular question of animal minds, and examine what science knows about minds and\nconsciousness in general. We will focus on examples taken from the study of human consciousness \u2013\nwhich is more accessible to us \u2013 and later on return to animals and ask whether what\u2019s true of humans\nis also true of our furry and feathery cousins.\nTo be frank, science knows surprisingly little about mind and consciousness. Current orthodoxy\nholds that consciousness is created by electrochemical reactions in the brain, and that mental\nexperiences fulfil some essential data-processing function.\n3 However, nobody has any idea how a\ncongeries of biochemical reactions and electrical currents in the brain creates the subjective\nexperience of pain, anger or love. Perhaps we will have a solid explanation in ten or fifty years. But\nas of 2016, we have no such explanation, and we had better be clear about that.\nUsing fMRI scans, implanted electrodes and other sophisticated gadgets, scientists have certainly\nidentified correlations and even causal links between electrical currents in the brain and various\nsubjective experiences. Just by looking at brain activity, scientists can know whether you are awake,\ndreaming or in deep sleep. They can briefly flash an image in front of your eyes, just at the threshold\nof conscious perception, and determine (without asking you) whether you have become aware of the\nimage or not. They have even managed to link individual brain neurons with specific mental content,\ndiscovering for example a \u2018Bill Clinton\u2019 neuron and a \u2018Homer Simpson\u2019 neuron. When the \u2018Bill\nClinton\u2019 neuron is on, the person is thinking of the forty-second president of the USA; show the person\nan image of Homer Simpson, and the eponymous neuron is bound to ignite.\nMore broadly, scientists know that if an electric storm arises in a given brain area, you probably\nfeel angry. If this storm subsides and a different area lights up \u2013 you are experiencing love. Indeed,\nscientists can even induce feelings of anger or love by electrically stimulating the right neurons. But\nhow on earth does the movement of electrons from one place to the other translate into a subjective\nimage of Bill Clinton, or a subjective feeling of anger or love?\nThe most common explanation points out that the brain is a highly complex system, with more than\n80 billion neurons connected into numerous intricate webs. When billions of neurons send billions of\nelectric signals back and forth, subjective experiences emerge. Even though the sending and receiving\nof each electric signal is a simple biochemical phenomenon, the interaction among all these signals\ncreates something far more complex \u2013 the stream of consciousness. We observe the same dynamic in\nmany other fields. The movement of a single car is a simple action, but when millions of cars move\nand interact simultaneously, traffic jams emerge. The buying and selling of a single share is simple\nenough, but when millions of traders buy and sell millions of shares it can lead to economic crises\nthat dumbfound even the experts.\nYet this explanation explains nothing. It merely affirms that the problem is very complicated. It\ndoes not offer any insight into how one kind of phenomenon (billions of electric signals moving from\nhere to there) creates a very different kind of phenomenon (subjective experiences of anger or love).\nThe analogy to other complex processes such as traffic jams and economic crises is flawed. What\ncreates a traffic jam? If you follow a single car, you will never understand it. The jam results from the\ninteractions among many cars. Car A influences the movement of car B, which blocks the path of car\nC, and so on. Yet if you map the movements of all the relevant cars, and how each impacts the other,\nyou will get a complete account of the traffic jam. It would be pointless to ask, \u2018But how do all these\nmovements create the traffic jam?\u2019 For \u2018traffic jam\u2019 is simply the abstract term we humans decided to\nuse for this particular collection of events.\nIn contrast, \u2018anger\u2019 isn\u2019t an abstract term we have decided to use as a shorthand for billions of\nelectric brain signals. Anger is an extremely concrete experience which people were familiar with\nlong before they knew anything about electricity. When I say, \u2018I am angry!\u2019 I am pointing to a very\ntangible feeling. If you describe how a chemical reaction in a neuron results in an electric signal, and\nhow billions of similar reactions result in billions of additional signals, it is still worthwhile to ask,\n\u2018But how do these billions of events come together to create my concrete feeling of anger?\u2019\nWhen thousands of cars slowly edge their way through London, we call that a traffic jam, but it\ndoesn\u2019t create some great Londonian consciousness that hovers high above Piccadilly and says to\nitself, \u2018Blimey, I feel jammed!\u2019 When millions of people sell billions of shares, we call that an\neconomic crisis, but no great Wall Street spirit grumbles, \u2018Shit, I feel I am in crisis.\u2019 When trillions of\nwater molecules coalesce in the sky we call that a cloud, but no cloud consciousness emerges to\nannounce, \u2018I feel rainy.\u2019 How is it, then, that when billions of electric signals move around in my\nbrain, a mind emerges that feels \u2018I am furious!\u2019? As of 2016, we have absolutely no idea.\nHence if this discussion has left you confused and perplexed, you are in very good company. The\nbest scientists too are a long way from deciphering the enigma of mind and consciousness. One of the\nwonderful things about science is that when scientists don\u2019t know something, they can try out all kinds\nof theories and conjunctures, but in the end they can just admit their ignorance.\nThe Equation of Life\nScientists don\u2019t know how a collection of electric brain signals creates subjective experiences. Even\nmore crucially, they don\u2019t know what could be the evolutionary benefit of such a phenomenon. It is the\ngreatest lacuna in our understanding of life. Humans have feet, because for millions of generations\nfeet enabled our ancestors to chase rabbits and escape lions. Humans have eyes, because for\ncountless millennia eyes enabled our forebears to see whither the rabbit was heading and whence the\nlion was coming. But why do humans have subjective experiences of hunger and fear?\nNot long ago, biologists gave a very simple answer. Subjective experiences are essential for our\nsurvival, because if we didn\u2019t feel hunger or fear we would not have bothered to chase rabbits and\nflee lions. Upon seeing a lion, why did a man flee? Well, he was frightened, so he ran away.\nSubjective experiences explained human actions. Yet today scientists provide a much more detailed\nexplanation. When a man sees a lion, electric signals move from the eye to the brain. The incoming\nsignals stimulate certain neurons, which react by firing off more signals. These stimulate other\nneurons down the line, which fire in their turn. If enough of the right neurons fire at a sufficiently\nrapid rate, commands are sent to the adrenal glands to flood the body with adrenaline, the heart is\ninstructed to beat faster, while neurons in the motor centre send signals down to the leg muscles,\nwhich begin to stretch and contract, and the man runs away from the lion.\nIronically, the better we map this process, the harder it becomes to explain conscious feelings. The\nbetter we understand the brain, the more redundant the mind seems. If the entire system works by\nelectric signals passing from here to there, why the hell do we also need to feel fear? If a chain of\nelectrochemical reactions leads all the way from the nerve cells in the eye to the movements of leg\nmuscles, why add subjective experiences to this chain? What do they do? Countless domino pieces\ncan fall one after the other without any need of subjective experiences. Why do neurons need feelings\nin order to stimulate one another, or in order to tell the adrenal gland to start pumping? Indeed, 99 per\ncent of bodily activities, including muscle movement and hormonal secretions, take place without any\nneed of conscious feelings. So why do the neurons, muscles and glands need such feelings in the\nremaining 1 per cent of cases?\nYou might argue that we need a mind because the mind stores memories, makes plans and\nautonomously sparks completely new images and ideas. It doesn\u2019t just respond to outside stimuli. For\nexample, when a man sees a lion, he doesn\u2019t react automatically to the sight of the predator. He\nremembers that a year ago a lion ate his aunt. He imagines how he would feel if a lion tore him to\npieces. He contemplates the fate of his orphaned children. That\u2019s why he flees. Indeed, many chain\nreactions begin with the mind\u2019s own initiative rather than with any immediate external stimulus. Thus\na memory of some prior lion attack might spontaneously pop up in a man\u2019s mind, setting him thinking\nabout the danger posed by lions. He then gets all the tribespeople together and they brainstorm novel\nmethods for scaring lions away.\nBut wait a moment. What are all these memories, imaginations and thoughts? Where do they exist?\nAccording to current biological theories, our memories, imaginations and thoughts don\u2019t exist in some\nhigher immaterial field. Rather, they too are avalanches of electric signals fired by billions of\nneurons. Hence even when we figure in memories, imaginations and thoughts, we are still left with a\nseries of electrochemical reactions that pass through billions of neurons, ending with the activity of\nadrenal glands and leg muscles.\nIs there even a single step on this long and twisting journey where, between the action of one\nneuron and the reaction of the next, the mind intervenes and decides whether the second neuron should\nfire or not? Is there any material movement, of even a single electron, that is caused by the subjective\nexperience of fear rather than by the prior movement of some other particle? If there is no such\nmovement \u2013 and if every electron moves because another electron moved earlier \u2013 why do we need\nto experience fear? We have no clue.\nPhilosophers have encapsulated this riddle in a trick question: what happens in the mind that\ndoesn\u2019t happen in the brain? If nothing happens in the mind except what happens in our massive\nnetwork of neurons \u2013 then why do we need the mind? If something does indeed happen in the mind\nover and above what happens in the neural network \u2013 where the hell does it happen? Suppose I ask\nyou what Homer Simpson thought about Bill Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky scandal. You have\nprobably never thought about this before, so your mind now needs to fuse two previously unrelated\nmemories, perhaps conjuring up an image of Homer drinking beer while watching the president give\nhis \u2018I did not have sexual relations with that woman\u2019speech. Where does this fusion take place?\nSome brain scientists argue that it happens in the \u2018global workspace\u2019 created by the interaction of\nmany neurons.\n4 Yet the word \u2018workspace\u2019 is just a metaphor. What is the reality behind the metaphor?\nWhere do the different pieces of information actually meet and fuse? According to current theories, it\ncertainly doesn\u2019t take place in some Platonic fifth dimension. Rather, it takes place, say, where two\npreviously unconnected neurons suddenly start firing signals to one another. A new synapse is formed\nbetween the Bill Clinton neuron and the Homer Simpson neuron. But if so, why do we need the\nconscious experience of memory over and above the physical event of the two neurons connecting?\nWe can pose the same riddle in mathematical terms. Present-day dogma holds that organisms are\nalgorithms, and that algorithms can be represented in mathematical formulas. You can use numbers\nand mathematical symbols to write the series of steps a vending machine takes to prepare a cup of tea,\nand the series of steps a brain takes when it is alarmed by the approach of a lion. If so, and if\nconscious experiences fulfil some important function, they must have a mathematical representation.\nFor they are an essential part of the algorithm. When we write the fear algorithm, and break \u2018fear\u2019\ndown into a series of precise calculations, we should be able to point out: \u2018Here, step number ninetythree in the calculation process \u2013 this is the subjective experience of fear!\u2019 But is there any algorithm\nin the huge realm of mathematics that contains a subjective experience? So far, we don\u2019t know of any\nsuch algorithm. Despite the vast knowledge we have gained in the fields of mathematics and computer\nscience, none of the data-processing systems we have created needs subjective experiences in order\nto function, and none feels pain, pleasure, anger or love.\n5\nMaybe we need subjective experiences in order to think about ourselves? An animal wandering the\nsavannah and calculating its chances of survival and reproduction must represent its own actions and\ndecisions to itself, and sometimes communicate them to other animals as well. As the brain tries to\ncreate a model of its own decisions, it gets trapped in an infinite digression, and abracadabra! Out of\nthis loop, consciousness pops out.\nFifty years ago this might have sounded plausible, but not in 2016. Several corporations, such as\nGoogle and Tesla, are engineering autonomous cars that already cruise our roads. The algorithms\ncontrolling the autonomous car make millions of calculations each second concerning other cars,\npedestrians, traffic lights and potholes. The autonomous car successfully stops at red lights, bypasses\nobstacles and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles \u2013 without feeling any fear. The car also needs\nto take itself into account and to communicate its plans and desires to the surrounding vehicles,\nbecause if it decides to swerve to the right, doing so will impact on their behaviour. The car does all\nthat without any problem \u2013 but without any consciousness either. The autonomous car isn\u2019t special.\nMany other computer programs make allowances for their own actions, yet none of them has\ndeveloped consciousness, and none feels or desires anything.\n6\nIf we cannot explain the mind, and if we don\u2019t know what function it fulfils, why not just discard it?\nThe history of science is replete with abandoned concepts and theories. For instance, early modern\nscientists who tried to account for the movement of light postulated the existence of a substance called\nether, which supposedly fills the entire universe. Light was thought to be waves of ether. However,\nscientists failed to find any empirical evidence for the existence of ether, whereas they did come up\nwith alternative and better theories of light. Consequently, they threw ether into the dustbin of science.\nThe Google autonomous car on the road.\n\u00a9 Karl Mondon/ZUMA Press/Corbis.\nSimilarly, for thousands of years humans used God to explain numerous natural phenomena. What\ncauses lightning to strike? God. What makes the rain fall? God. How did life on earth begin? God did\nit. Over the last few centuries scientists have not discovered any empirical evidence for God\u2019s\nexistence, while they did find much more detailed explanations for lightning strikes, rain and the\norigins of life. Consequently, with the exception of a few subfields of philosophy, no article in any\npeer-review scientific journal takes God\u2019s existence seriously. Historians don\u2019t argue that the Allies\nwon the Second World War because God was on their side; economists don\u2019t blame God for the 1929\neconomic crisis; and geologists don\u2019t invoke His will to explain tectonic plate movements.\nThe same fate has befallen the soul. For thousands of years people believed that all our actions and\ndecisions emanate from our souls. Yet in the absence of any supporting evidence, and given the\nexistence of much more detailed alternative theories, the life sciences have ditched the soul. As\nprivate individuals, many biologists and doctors may go on believing in souls. Yet they never write\nabout them in serious scientific journals.\nMaybe the mind should join the soul, God and ether in the dustbin of science? After all, no one has\never seen experiences of pain or love through a microscope, and we have a very detailed\nbiochemical explanation for pain and love that leaves no room for subjective experiences. However,\nthere is a crucial difference between mind and soul (as well as between mind and God). Whereas the\nexistence of eternal souls is pure conjecture, the experience of pain is a direct and very tangible\nreality. When I step on a nail, I can be 100 per cent certain that I feel pain (even if I so far lack a\nscientific explanation for it). In contrast, I cannot be certain that if the wound becomes infected and I\ndie of gangrene, my soul will continue to exist. It\u2019s a very interesting and comforting story which I\nwould be happy to believe, but I have no direct evidence for its veracity. Since all scientists\nconstantly experience subjective feelings such as pain and doubt, they cannot deny their existence.\nAnother way to dismiss mind and consciousness is to deny their relevance rather than their\nexistence. Some scientists \u2013 such as Daniel Dennett and Stanislas Dehaene \u2013 argue that all relevant\nquestions can be answered by studying brain activities, without any recourse to subjective\nexperiences. So scientists can safely delete \u2018mind\u2019, \u2018consciousness\u2019 and \u2018subjective experiences\u2019\nfrom their vocabulary and articles. However, as we shall see in the following chapters, the whole\nedifice of modern politics and ethics is built upon subjective experiences, and few ethical dilemmas\ncan be solved by referring strictly to brain activities. For example, what\u2019s wrong with torture or\nrape? From a purely neurological perspective, when a human is tortured or raped certain biochemical\nreactions happen in the brain, and various electrical signals move from one bunch of neurons to\nanother. What could possibly be wrong with that? Most modern people have ethical qualms about\ntorture and rape because of the subjective experiences involved. If any scientist wants to argue that\nsubjective experiences are irrelevant, their challenge is to explain why torture or rape are wrong\nwithout reference to any subjective experience.\nFinally, some scientists concede that consciousness is real and may actually have great moral and\npolitical value, but that it fulfils no biological function whatsoever. Consciousness is the biologically\nuseless by-product of certain brain processes. Jet engines roar loudly, but the noise doesn\u2019t propel the\naeroplane forward. Humans don\u2019t need carbon dioxide, but each and every breath fills the air with\nmore of the stuff. Similarly, consciousness may be a kind of mental pollution produced by the firing of\ncomplex neural networks. It doesn\u2019t do anything. It is just there. If this is true, it implies that all the\npain and pleasure experienced by billions of creatures for millions of years is just mental pollution.\nThis is certainly a thought worth thinking, even if it isn\u2019t true. But it is quite amazing to realise that as\nof 2016, this is the best theory of consciousness that contemporary science has to offer us.\nMaybe the life sciences view the problem from the wrong angle. They believe that life is all about\ndata processing, and that organisms are machines for making calculations and taking decisions.\nHowever, this analogy between organisms and algorithms might mislead us. In the nineteenth century,\nscientists described brains and minds as if they were steam engines. Why steam engines? Because that\nwas the leading technology of the day, which powered trains, ships and factories, so when humans\ntried to explain life, they assumed it must work according to analogous principles. Mind and body are\nmade of pipes, cylinders, valves and pistons that build and release pressure, thereby producing\nmovements and actions. Such thinking had a deep influence even on Freudian psychology, which is\nwhy much of our psychological jargon is still replete with concepts borrowed from mechanical\nengineering.\nConsider, for example, the following Freudian argument: \u2018Armies harness the sex drive to fuel\nmilitary aggression. The army recruits young men just when their sexual drive is at its peak. The army\nlimits the soldiers\u2019 opportunities of actually having sex and releasing all that pressure, which\nconsequently accumulates inside them. The army then redirects this pent-up pressure and allows it to\nbe released in the form of military aggression.\u2019 This is exactly how a steam engine works. You trap\nboiling steam inside a closed container. The steam builds up more and more pressure, until suddenly\nyou open a valve, and release the pressure in a predetermined direction, harnessing it to propel a\ntrain or a loom. Not only in armies, but in all fields of activity, we often complain about the pressure\nbuilding up inside us, and we fear that unless we \u2018let off some steam\u2019, we might explode.\nIn the twenty-first century it sounds childish to compare the human psyche to a steam engine. Today\nwe know of a far more sophisticated technology \u2013 the computer \u2013 so we explain the human psyche as\nif it were a computer processing data rather than a steam engine regulating pressure. But this new\nanalogy may turn out to be just as na\u00efve. After all, computers have no minds. They don\u2019t crave\nanything even when they have a bug, and the Internet doesn\u2019t feel pain even when authoritarian\nregimes sever entire countries from the Web. So why use computers as a model for understanding the\nmind?\nWell, are we really sure that computers have no sensations or desires? And even if they haven\u2019t got\nany at present, perhaps once they become complex enough they might develop consciousness? If that\nwere to happen, how could we ascertain it? When computers replace our bus driver, our teacher and\nour shrink, how could we determine whether they have feelings or whether they are just a collection\nof mindless algorithms?\nWhen it comes to humans, we are today capable of differentiating between conscious mental\nexperiences and non-conscious brain activities. Though we are far from understanding consciousness,\nscientists have succeeded in identifying some of its electrochemical signatures. To do so the scientists\nstarted with the assumption that whenever humans report that they are conscious of something, they\ncan be believed. Based on this assumption the scientists could then isolate specific brain patterns that\nappear every time humans report being conscious, but that never appear during unconscious states.\nThis has allowed the scientists to determine, for example, whether a seemingly vegetative stroke\nvictim has completely lost consciousness, or has merely lost control of his body and speech. If the\npatient\u2019s brain displays the telltale signatures of consciousness, he is probably conscious, even though\nhe cannot move or speak. Indeed, doctors have recently managed to communicate with such patients\nusing fMRI imaging. They ask the patients yes/no questions, telling them to imagine themselves\nplaying tennis if the answer is yes, and to visualise the location of their home if the answer is no. The\ndoctors can then observe how the motor cortex lights up when patients imagine playing tennis\n(meaning \u2018yes\u2019), whereas \u2018no\u2019 is indicated by the activation of brain areas responsible for spatial\nmemory.\n7\nThis is all very well for humans, but what about computers? Since silicon-based computers have\nvery different structures to carbon-based human neural networks, the human signatures of\nconsciousness may not be relevant to them. We seem to be trapped in a vicious circle. Starting with\nthe assumption that we can believe humans when they report that they are conscious, we can identify\nthe signatures of human consciousness, and then use these signatures to \u2018prove\u2019 that humans are indeed\nconscious. But if an artificial intelligence self-reports that it is conscious, should we just believe it?\nSo far, we have no good answer to this problem. Already thousands of years ago philosophers\nrealised that there is no way to prove conclusively that anyone other than oneself has a mind. Indeed,\neven in the case of other humans, we just assume they have consciousness \u2013 we cannot know that for\ncertain. Perhaps I am the only being in the entire universe who feels anything, and all other humans\nand animals are just mindless robots? Perhaps I am dreaming, and everyone I meet is just a character\nin my dream? Perhaps I am trapped inside a virtual world, and all the beings I see are merely\nsimulations?\nAccording to current scientific dogma, everything I experience is the result of electrical activity in\nmy brain, and it should therefore be theoretically feasible to simulate an entire virtual world that I\ncould not possibly distinguish from the \u2018real\u2019 world. Some brain scientists believe that in the not too\ndistant future, we shall actually do such things. Well, maybe it has already been done \u2013 to you? For all\nyou know, the year might be 2216 and you are a bored teenager immersed inside a \u2018virtual world\u2019\ngame that simulates the primitive and exciting world of the early twenty-first century. Once you\nacknowledge the mere feasibility of this scenario, mathematics leads you to a very scary conclusion:\nsince there is only one real world, whereas the number of potential virtual worlds is infinite, the\nprobability that you happen to inhabit the sole real world is almost zero.\nNone of our scientific breakthroughs has managed to overcome this notorious Problem of Other\nMinds. The best test that scholars have so far come up with is called the Turing Test, but it examines\nonly social conventions. According to the Turing Test, in order to determine whether a computer has a\nmind, you should communicate simultaneously both with that computer and with a real person,\nwithout knowing which is which. You can ask whatever questions you want, you can play games,\nargue, and even flirt with them. Take as much time as you like. Then you need to decide which is the\ncomputer, and which is the human. If you cannot make up your mind, or if you make a mistake, the\ncomputer has passed the Turing Test, and we should treat it as if it really has a mind. However, that\nwon\u2019t really be a proof, of course. Acknowledging the existence of other minds is merely a social and\nlegal convention.\nThe Turing Test was invented in 1950 by the British mathematician Alan Turing, one of the fathers\nof the computer age. Turing was also a gay man in a period when homosexuality was illegal in\nBritain. In 1952 he was convicted of committing homosexual acts and forced to undergo chemical\ncastration. Two years later he committed suicide. The Turing Test is simply a replication of a\nmundane test every gay man had to undergo in 1950 Britain: can you pass for a straight man? Turing\nknew from personal experience that it didn\u2019t matter who you really were \u2013 it mattered only what\nothers thought about you. According to Turing, in the future computers would be just like gay men in\nthe 1950s. It won\u2019t matter whether computers will actually be conscious or not. It will matter only\nwhat people think about it.\nThe Depressing Lives of Laboratory Rats\nHaving acquainted ourselves with the mind \u2013 and with how little we really know about it \u2013 we can\nreturn to the question of whether other animals have minds. Some animals, such as dogs, certainly\npass a modified version of the Turing Test. When humans try to determine whether an entity is\nconscious, what we usually look for is not mathematical aptitude or good memory, but rather the\nability to create emotional relationships with us. People sometimes develop deep emotional\nattachments to fetishes like weapons, cars and even underwear, but these attachments are one-sided\nand never develop into relationships. The fact that dogs can be party to emotional relationships with\nhumans convinces most dog owners that dogs are not mindless automata.\nThis, however, won\u2019t satisfy sceptics, who point out that emotions are algorithms, and that no\nknown algorithm requires consciousness in order to function. Whenever an animal displays complex\nemotional behaviour, we cannot prove that this is not the result of some very sophisticated but nonconscious algorithm. This argument, of course, can be applied to humans too. Everything a human\ndoes \u2013 including reporting on allegedly conscious states \u2013 might in theory be the work of nonconscious algorithms.\nIn the case of humans, we nevertheless assume that whenever someone reports that he or she is\nconscious, we can take their word for it. Based on this minimal assumption, we can today identify the\nbrain signatures of consciousness, which can then be used systematically to differentiate conscious\nfrom non-conscious states in humans. Yet since animal brains share many features with human brains,\nas our understanding of the signatures of consciousness deepens, we might be able to use them to\ndetermine if and when other animals are conscious. If a canine brain shows similar patterns to those\nof a conscious human brain, this will provide strong evidence that dogs are conscious.\nInitial tests on monkeys and mice indicate that at least monkey and mice brains indeed display the\nsignatures of consciousness.\n8 However, given the differences between animal brains and human\nbrains, and given that we are still far from deciphering all the secrets of consciousness, developing\ndecisive tests that will satisfy the sceptics might take decades. Who should carry the burden of proof\nin the meantime? Do we consider dogs to be mindless machines until proven otherwise, or do we\ntreat dogs as conscious beings as long as nobody comes up with some convincing counter-evidence?\nOn 7 July 2012 leading experts in neurobiology and the cognitive sciences gathered at the\nUniversity of Cambridge, and signed the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, which says that\n\u2018Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical and\nneurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional\nbehaviours. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing\nthe neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals\nand birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological\nsubstrates.\u2019\n9 This declaration stops short of saying that other animals are conscious, because we still\nlack the smoking gun. But it does shift the burden of proof to those who think otherwise.\nResponding to the shifting winds of the scientific community, in May 2015 New Zealand became\nthe first country in the world to legally recognise animals as sentient beings, when the New Zealand\nparliament passed the Animal Welfare Amendment Act. The Act stipulates that it is now obligatory to\nrecognise animals as sentient, and hence attend properly to their welfare in contexts such as animal\nhusbandry. In a country with far more sheep than humans (30 million vs 4.5 million), that is a very\nsignificant statement. The Canadian province of Quebec has since passed a similar Act, and other\ncountries are likely to follow suit.\nMany business corporations also recognise animals as sentient beings, though paradoxically, this\noften exposes the animals to rather unpleasant laboratory tests. For example, pharmaceutical\ncompanies routinely use rats as experimental subjects in the development of antidepressants.\nAccording to one widely used protocol, you take a hundred rats (for statistical reliability) and place\neach rat inside a glass tube filled with water. The rats struggle again and again to climb out of the\ntubes, without success. After fifteen minutes most give up and stop moving. They just float in the tube,\napathetic to their surroundings.\nYou now take another hundred rats, throw them in, but fish them out of the tube after fourteen\nminutes, just before they are about to despair. You dry them, feed them, give them a little rest \u2013 and\nthen throw them back in. The second time, most rats struggle for twenty minutes before calling it quits.\nWhy the extra six minutes? Because the memory of past success triggers the release of some\nbiochemical in the brain that gives the rats hope and delays the advent of despair. If we could only\nisolate this biochemical, we might use it as an antidepressant for humans. But numerous chemicals\nflood a rat\u2019s brain at any given moment. How can we pinpoint the right one?\nFor this you take more groups of rats, who have never participated in the test before. You inject\neach group with a particular chemical, which you suspect to be the hoped-for antidepressant. You\nthrow the rats into the water. If rats injected with chemical A struggle for only fifteen minutes before\nbecoming depressed, you can cross out A on your list. If rats injected with chemical B go on thrashing\nfor twenty minutes, you can tell the CEO and the shareholders that you might have just hit the jackpot.\nLeft: A hopeful rat struggling to escape the glass tube. Right: An apathetic rat floating in the glass tube, having lost all hope.\nAdapted from Weiss, J.M., Cierpial, M.A. & West, C.H., \u2018Selective breeding of rats for high and low motor activity in a swim test:\ntoward a new animal model of depression\u2019, Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior 61:49\u201366 (1998).\nSceptics could object that this entire description needlessly humanises rats. Rats experience neither\nhope nor despair. Sometimes rats move quickly and sometimes they stand still, but they never feel\nanything. They are driven only by non-conscious algorithms. Yet if so, what\u2019s the point of all these\nexperiments? Psychiatric drugs are aimed to induce changes not just in human behaviour, but above\nall in human feeling. When customers go to a psychiatrist and say, \u2018Doctor, give me something that\nwill lift me out of this depression,\u2019 they don\u2019t want a mechanical stimulant that will cause them to flail\nabout while still feeling blue. They want to feel cheerful. Conducting experiments on rats can help\ncorporations develop such a magic pill only if they presuppose that rat behaviour is accompanied by\nhuman-like emotions. And indeed, this is a common presupposition in psychiatric laboratories.\n10\nThe Self-Conscious Chimpanzee\nAnother attempt to enshrine human superiority accepts that rats, dogs and other animals have\nconsciousness, but argues that, unlike humans, they lack self-consciousness. They may feel depressed,\nhappy, hungry or satiated, but they have no notion of self, and they are not aware that the depression\nor hunger they feel belongs to a unique entity called \u2018I\u2019.\nThis idea is as common as it is opaque. Obviously, when a dog feels hungry, he grabs a piece of\nmeat for himself rather than serve food to another dog. Let a dog sniff a tree watered by the\nneighbourhood dogs, and he will immediately know whether it smells of his own urine, of the\nneighbour\u2019s cute Labrador\u2019s or of some stranger\u2019s. Dogs react very differently to their own odour and\nto the odours of potential mates and rivals.\n11 So what does it mean that they lack self-consciousness?\nA more sophisticated version of the argument says that there are different levels of selfconsciousness. Only humans understand themselves as an enduring self that has a past and a future,\nperhaps because only humans can use language in order to contemplate their past experiences and\nfuture actions. Other animals exist in an eternal present. Even when they seem to remember the past or\nplan for the future, they are in fact reacting only to present stimuli and momentary urges.\n12 For\ninstance, a squirrel hiding nuts for the winter doesn\u2019t really remember the hunger he felt last winter,\nnor is he thinking about the future. He just follows a momentary urge, oblivious to the origins and\npurpose of this urge. That\u2019s why even very young squirrels, who haven\u2019t yet lived through a winter\nand hence cannot remember winter, nevertheless cache nuts during the summer.\nYet it is unclear why language should be a necessary condition for being aware of past or future\nevents. The fact that humans use language to do so is hardly a proof. Humans also use language to\nexpress their love or their fear, but other animals may well experience and even express love and fear\nnon-verbally. Indeed, humans themselves are often aware of past and future events without\nverbalising them. Especially in dream states, we can be aware of entire non-verbal narratives \u2013\nwhich upon waking we struggle to describe in words.\nVarious experiments indicate that at least some animals \u2013 including birds such as parrots and scrub\njays \u2013 do remember individual incidents and consciously plan for future eventualities.\n13 However, it\nis impossible to prove this beyond doubt, because no matter how sophisticated a behaviour an animal\nexhibits, sceptics can always claim that it results from unconscious algorithms in its brain rather than\nfrom conscious images in its mind.\nTo illustrate this problem consider the case of Santino, a male chimpanzee from the Furuvik Zoo in\nSweden. To relieve the boredom in his compound Santino developed an exciting hobby: throwing\nstones at visitors to the zoo. In itself, this is hardly unique. Angry chimpanzees often throw stones,\nsticks and even excrement. However, Santino was planning his moves in advance. During the early\nmorning, long before the zoo opened for visitors, Santino collected projectiles and placed them in a\nheap, without showing any visible signs of anger. Guides and visitors soon learned to be wary of\nSantino, especially when he was standing near his pile of stones, hence he had increasing difficulties\nin finding targets.\nIn May 2010, Santino responded with a new strategy. In the early morning he took bales of straw\nfrom his sleeping quarters and placed them close to the compound\u2019s wall, where visitors usually\ngather to watch the chimps. He then collected stones and hid them under the straw. An hour or so\nlater, when the first visitors approached, Santino kept his cool, showing no signs of irritation or\naggression. Only when his victims were within range did Santino suddenly grab the stones from their\nhiding place and bombard the frightened humans, who would scuttle in all directions. In the summer\nof 2012 Santino sped up the arms race, caching stones not only under straw bales, but also in tree\ntrunks, buildings and any other suitable hiding place.\nYet even Santino doesn\u2019t satisfy the sceptics. How can we be certain that at 7 a.m., when Santino\ngoes about secreting stones here and there, he is imagining how fun it will be to pelt the visiting\nhumans at noon? Maybe Santino is driven by some non-conscious algorithm, just like a young squirrel\nhiding nuts \u2018for winter\u2019 even though he has never experienced winter?\n14\nSimilarly, say the sceptics, a male chimpanzee attacking a rival who hurt him weeks earlier isn\u2019t\nreally avenging the old insult. He is just reacting to a momentary feeling of anger, the cause of which\nis beyond him. When a mother elephant sees a lion threatening her calf, she rushes forward and risks\nher life not because she remembers that this is her beloved offspring whom she has been nurturing for\nmonths; rather, she is impelled by some unfathomable sense of hostility towards the lion. And when a\ndog jumps for joy when his owner comes home, the dog isn\u2019t recognising the man who fed and\ncuddled him from infancy. He is simply overwhelmed by an unexplained ecstasy.\n15\nWe cannot prove or disprove any of these claims, because they are in fact variations on the\nProblem of Other Minds. Since we aren\u2019t familiar with any algorithm that requires consciousness,\nanything an animal does can be seen as the product of non-conscious algorithms rather than of\nconscious memories and plans. So in Santino\u2019s case too, the real question concerns the burden of\nproof. What is the most likely explanation for Santino\u2019s behaviour? Should we assume that he is\nconsciously planning for the future, and anyone who disagrees should provide some counterevidence? Or is it more reasonable to think that the chimpanzee is driven by a non-conscious\nalgorithm, and all he consciously feels is a mysterious urge to place stones under bales of straw?\nAnd even if Santino doesn\u2019t remember the past and doesn\u2019t imagine the future, does it mean he\nlacks self-consciousness? After all, we ascribe self-consciousness to humans even when they are not\nbusy remembering the past or dreaming about the future. For example, when a human mother sees her\ntoddler wandering onto a busy road, she doesn\u2019t stop to think about either past or future. Just like the\nmother elephant, she too just races to save her child. Why not say about her what we say about the\nelephant, namely that \u2018when the mother rushed to save her baby from the oncoming danger, she did it\nwithout any self-consciousness. She was merely driven by a momentary urge\u2019?\nSimilarly, consider a young couple kissing passionately on their first date, a soldier charging into\nheavy enemy fire to save a wounded comrade, or an artist drawing a masterpiece in a frenzy of\nbrushstrokes. None of them stops to contemplate the past or the future. Does it mean they lack selfconsciousness, and that their state of being is inferior to that of a politician giving an election speech\nabout his past achievements and future plans?\nThe Clever Horse\nIn 2010 scientists conducted an unusually touching rat experiment. They locked a rat in a tiny cage,\nplaced the cage within a much larger cell and allowed another rat to roam freely through that cell. The\ncaged rat gave out distress signals, which caused the free rat also to exhibit signs of anxiety and\nstress. In most cases, the free rat proceeded to help her trapped companion, and after several attempts\nusually succeeded in opening the cage and liberating the prisoner. The researchers then repeated the\nexperiment, this time placing chocolate in the cell. The free rat now had to choose between either\nliberating the prisoner, or enjoying the chocolate all by herself. Many rats preferred to first free their\ncompanion and share the chocolate (though quite a few behaved more selfishly, proving perhaps that\nsome rats are meaner than others).\nSceptics dismissed these results, arguing that the free rat liberated the prisoner not out of empathy,\nbut simply in order to stop the annoying distress signals. The rats were motivated by the unpleasant\nsensations they felt, and they sought nothing grander than ending these sensations. Maybe. But we\ncould say exactly the same thing about us humans. When I donate money to a beggar, am I not reacting\nto the unpleasant sensations that the sight of the beggar causes me to feel? Do I really care about the\nbeggar, or do I simply want to feel better myself?\n16\nIn essence, we humans are not that different from rats, dogs, dolphins or chimpanzees. Like them,\nwe too have no soul. Like us, they too have consciousness and a complex world of sensations and\nemotions. Of course, every animal has its unique traits and talents. Humans too have their special\ngifts. We shouldn\u2019t humanise animals needlessly, imagining that they are just a furrier version of\nourselves. This is not only bad science, but it also prevents us from understanding and valuing other\nanimals on their terms.\nIn the early 1900s, a horse called Clever Hans became a German celebrity. Touring Germany\u2019s\ntowns and villages, Hans showed off a remarkable grasp of the German language, and an even more\nremarkable mastery of mathematics. When asked, \u2018Hans, what is four times three?\u2019 Hans tapped his\nhoof twelve times. When shown a written message asking, \u2018What is twenty minus eleven?\u2019 Hans\ntapped nine times, with commendable Prussian precision.\nIn 1904 the German board of education appointed a special scientific commission headed by a\npsychologist to look into the matter. The thirteen members of the commission \u2013 which included a\ncircus manager and a veterinarian \u2013 were convinced this must be a scam, but despite their best efforts\nthey couldn\u2019t uncover any fraud or subterfuge. Even when Hans was separated from his owner, and\ncomplete strangers presented him with the questions, Hans still got most of the answers right.\nIn 1907 the psychologist Oskar Pfungst began another investigation that finally revealed the truth. It\nturned out that Hans got the answers right by carefully observing the body language and facial\nexpressions of his interlocutors. When Hans was asked what is four times three, he knew from past\nexperience that the human was expecting him to tap his hoof a given number of times. He began\ntapping, while closely monitoring the human. As Hans approached the correct number of taps the\nhuman became more and more tense, and when Hans tapped the right number, the tension reached its\npeak. Hans knew how to recognise this by the human\u2019s body posture and the look on the human\u2019s face.\nHe then stopped tapping, and watched how tension was replaced by amazement or laughter. Hans\nknew he had got it right.\nClever Hans is often given as an example of the way humans erroneously humanise animals,\nascribing to them far more amazing abilities than they actually possess. In fact, however, the lesson is\njust the opposite. The story demonstrates that by humanising animals we usually underestimate\nanimal cognition and ignore the unique abilities of other creatures. As far as maths goes, Hans was\nhardly a genius. Any eight-year-old kid could do much better. However, in his ability to deduce\nemotions and intentions from body language, Hans was a true genius. If a Chinese person were to ask\nme in Mandarin what is four times three, there is no way that I could correctly tap my foot twelve\ntimes simply by observing facial expressions and body language. Clever Hans enjoyed this ability\nbecause horses normally communicate with each other through body language. What was remarkable\nabout Hans, however, is that he could use the method to decipher the emotions and intentions not only\nof his fellow horses, but also of unfamiliar humans.\nClever Hans on stage in 1904.\n\u00a9 2004 TopFoto.\nIf animals are so clever, why don\u2019t horses harness humans to carts, rats conduct experiments on us,\nand dolphins make us jump through hoops? Homo sapiens surely has some unique ability that enables\nit to dominate all the other animals. Having dismissed the overblown notions that Homo sapiens\nexists on an entirely different plain from other animals, or that humans possess some unique essence\nlike soul or consciousness, we can finally climb down to the level of reality and examine the\nparticular physical or mental abilities that give our species its edge.\nMost studies cite tool production and intelligence as particularly important for the ascent of\nhumankind. Though other animals also produce tools, there is little doubt that humans far surpass them\nin that field. Things are a bit less clear with regard to intelligence. An entire industry is devoted to\ndefining and measuring intelligence but is a long way from reaching a consensus. Luckily, we don\u2019t\nhave to enter into that minefield, because no matter how one defines intelligence, it is quite clear that\nneither intelligence nor toolmaking by themselves can account for the Sapiens conquest of the world.\nAccording to most definitions of intelligence, a million years ago humans were already the most\nintelligent animals around, as well as the world\u2019s champion toolmakers, yet they remained\ninsignificant creatures with little impact on the surrounding ecosystem. They were obviously lacking\nsome key feature other than intelligence and toolmaking.\nPerhaps humankind eventually came to dominate the planet not because of some elusive third key\ningredient, but due simply to the evolution of even higher intelligence and even better toolmaking\nabilities? It doesn\u2019t seem so, because when we examine the historical record, we don\u2019t see a direct\ncorrelation between the intelligence and toolmaking abilities of individual humans and the power of\nour species as a whole. Twenty thousand years ago, the average Sapiens probably had higher\nintelligence and better toolmaking skills than the average Sapiens of today. Modern schools and\nemployers may test our aptitudes from time to time but, no matter how badly we do, the welfare state\nalways guarantees our basic needs. In the Stone Age natural selection tested you every single moment\nof every single day, and if you flunked any of its numerous tests you were pushing up the daisies in no\ntime. Yet despite the superior toolmaking abilities of our Stone Age ancestors, and despite their\nsharper minds and far more acute senses, 20,000 years ago humankind was much weaker than it is\ntoday.\nOver those 20,000 years humankind moved from hunting mammoth with stone-tipped spears to\nexploring the solar system with spaceships not thanks to the evolution of more dexterous hands or\nbigger brains (our brains today seem actually to be smaller).\n17\nInstead, the crucial factor in our\nconquest of the world was our ability to connect many humans to one another.\n18 Humans nowadays\ncompletely dominate the planet not because the individual human is far smarter and more nimblefingered than the individual chimp or wolf, but because Homo sapiens is the only species on earth\ncapable of co-operating flexibly in large numbers. Intelligence and toolmaking were obviously very\nimportant as well. But if humans had not learned to cooperate flexibly in large numbers, our crafty\nbrains and deft hands would still be splitting flint stones rather than uranium atoms.\nIf cooperation is the key, how come the ants and bees did not beat us to the nuclear bomb even\nthough they learned to cooperate en masse millions of years before us? Because their cooperation\nlacks flexibility. Bees cooperate in very sophisticated ways, but they cannot reinvent their social\nsystem overnight. If a hive faces a new threat or a new opportunity, the bees cannot, for example,\nguillotine the queen and establish a republic.\nSocial mammals such as elephants and chimpanzees cooperate far more flexibly than bees, but they\ndo so only with small numbers of friends and family members. Their cooperation is based on\npersonal acquaintance. If I am a chimpanzee and you are a chimpanzee and I want to cooperate with\nyou, I must know you personally: what kind of chimp are you? Are you a nice chimp? Are you an evil\nchimp? How can I cooperate with you if I don\u2019t know you? To the best of our knowledge, only\nSapiens can cooperate in very flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. This concrete\ncapability \u2013 rather than an eternal soul or some unique kind of consciousness \u2013 explains our mastery\nof planet Earth.\nLong Live the Revolution!\nHistory provides ample evidence for the crucial importance of large-scale cooperation. Victory\nalmost invariably went to those who cooperated better \u2013 not only in struggles between Homo sapiens\nand other animals, but also in conflicts between different human groups. Thus Rome conquered\nGreece not because the Romans had larger brains or better toolmaking techniques, but because they\nwere able to cooperate more effectively. Throughout history, disciplined armies easily routed\ndisorganised hordes, and unified elites dominated the disorderly masses. In 1914, for example, 3\nmillion Russian noblemen, officials and business people lorded it over 180 million peasants and\nworkers. The Russian elite knew how to cooperate in defence of its common interests, whereas the\n180 million commoners were incapable of effective mobilisation. Indeed, much of the elite\u2019s efforts\nfocused on ensuring that the 180 million people at the bottom would never learn to cooperate.\nIn order to mount a revolution, numbers are never enough. Revolutions are usually made by small\nnetworks of agitators rather than by the masses. If you want to launch a revolution, don\u2019t ask yourself,\n\u2018How many people support my ideas?\u2019 Instead, ask yourself, \u2018How many of my supporters are\ncapable of effective collaboration?\u2019 The Russian Revolution finally erupted not when 180 million\npeasants rose against the tsar, but rather when a handful of communists placed themselves at the right\nplace at the right time. In 1917, at a time when the Russian upper and middle classes numbered at\nleast 3 million people, the Communist Party had just 23,000 members.\n19 The communists nevertheless\ngained control of the vast Russian Empire because they organised themselves well. When authority in\nRussia slipped from the decrepit hands of the tsar and the equally shaky hands of Kerensky\u2019s\nprovisional government, the communists seized it with alacrity, gripping the reins of power like a\nbulldog locking its jaws on a bone.\nThe communists didn\u2019t release their grip until the late 1980s. Effective organisation kept them in\npower for eight long decades, and they eventually fell due to defective organisation. On 21 December\n1989 Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu, the communist dictator of Romania, organised a mass demonstration of\nsupport in the centre of Bucharest. Over the previous months the Soviet Union had withdrawn its\nsupport from the eastern European communist regimes, the Berlin Wall had fallen, and revolutions\nhad swept Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. Ceau\u015fescu, who had ruled\nRomania since 1965, believed he could withstand the tsunami, even though riots against his rule had\nerupted in the Romanian city of Timi\u015foara on 17 December. As one of his counter-measures,\nCeau\u015fescu arranged a massive rally in Bucharest to prove to Romanians and the rest of the world that\nthe majority of the populace still loved him \u2013 or at least feared him. The creaking party apparatus\nmobilised 80,000 people to fill the city\u2019s central square, and citizens throughout Romania were\ninstructed to stop all their activities and tune in on their radios and televisions.\nTo the cheering of the seemingly enthusiastic crowd, Ceau\u015fescu mounted the balcony overlooking\nthe square, as he had done scores of times in previous decades. Flanked by his wife Elena, leading\nparty officials and a bevy of bodyguards, Ceau\u015fescu began delivering one of his trademark dreary\nspeeches. For eight minutes he praised the glories of Romanian socialism, looking very pleased with\nhimself as the crowd clapped mechanically. And then something went wrong. You can see it for\nyourself on YouTube. Just search for \u2018Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s last speech\u2019, and watch history in action.\n20\nThe YouTube clip shows Ceau\u015fescu starting another long sentence, saying, \u2018I want to thank the\ninitiators and organisers of this great event in Bucharest, considering it as a\u2014\u2019, and then he falls\nsilent, his eyes open wide, and he freezes in disbelief. He never finished the sentence. You can see in\nthat split second how an entire world collapses. Somebody in the audience booed. People still argue\ntoday who was the first person who dared to boo. And then another person booed, and another, and\nanother, and within a few seconds the masses began whistling, shouting abuse and calling out \u2018Ti-mi\u015foa-ra! Ti-mi-\u015foa-ra!\u2019\nThe moment a world collapses: a stunned Ceau\u015fescu cannot believe his eyes and ears.\nFilm still taken from www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWIbCtz_Xwk\u00a9TVR.\nAll this happened live on Romanian television, as three-quarters of the populace sat glued to the\nscreens, their hearts throbbing wildly. The notorious secret police \u2013 the Securitate \u2013 immediately\nordered the broadcast to be stopped, but the television crews disobeyed. The cameraman pointed the\ncamera towards the sky so that viewers couldn\u2019t see the panic among the party leaders on the balcony,\nbut the soundman kept recording, and the technicians continued the transmission. The whole of\nRomania heard the crowd booing, while Ceau\u015fescu yelled, \u2018Hello! Hello! Hello!\u2019 as if the problem\nwas with the microphone. His wife Elena began scolding the audience, \u2018Be quiet! Be quiet!\u2019 until\nCeau\u015fescu turned and yelled at her \u2013 still live on television \u2013 \u2018You be quiet!\u2019 Ceau\u015fescu then\nappealed to the excited crowds in the square, imploring them, \u2018Comrades! Comrades! Be quiet,\ncomrades!\u2019\nBut the comrades were unwilling to be quiet. Communist Romania crumbled when 80,000 people\nin the Bucharest central square realised they were much stronger than the old man in the fur hat on the\nbalcony. What is truly astounding, however, is not the moment the system collapsed, but the fact that it\nmanaged to survive for decades. Why are revolutions so rare? Why do the masses sometimes clap\nand cheer for centuries on end, doing everything the man on the balcony commands them, even though\nthey could in theory charge forward at any moment and tear him to pieces?\nCeau\u015fescu and his cronies dominated 20 million Romanians for four decades because they ensured\nthree vital conditions. First, they placed loyal communist apparatchiks in control of all networks of\ncooperation, such as the army, trade unions and even sports associations. Second, they prevented the\ncreation of any rival organisations \u2013 whether political, economic or social \u2013 which might serve as a\nbasis for anti-communist cooperation. Third, they relied on the support of sister communist parties in\nthe Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Despite occasional tensions, these parties helped each other in\ntimes of need, or at least guaranteed that no outsider poked his nose into the socialist paradise. Under\nsuch conditions, despite all the hardship and suffering inflicted on them by the ruling elite, the 20\nmillion Romanians were unable to organise any effective opposition.\nCeau\u015fescu fell from power only once all three conditions no longer held. In the late 1980s the\nSoviet Union withdrew its protection and the communist regimes began falling like dominoes. By\nDecember 1989 Ceau\u015fescu could not expect any outside assistance. Just the opposite \u2013 revolutions in\nnearby countries gave heart to the local opposition. The Communist Party itself began splitting into\nrival camps. The moderates wished to rid themselves of Ceau\u015fescu and initiate reforms before it was\ntoo late. By organising the Bucharest demonstration and broadcasting it live on television, Ceau\u015fescu\nhimself provided the revolutionaries with the perfect opportunity to discover their power and rally\nagainst him. What quicker way to spread a revolution than by showing it on TV?\nYet when power slipped from the hands of the clumsy organiser on the balcony, it did not pass to\nthe masses in the square. Though numerous and enthusiastic, the crowds did not know how to organise\nthemselves. Hence just as in Russia in 1917, power passed to a small group of political players\nwhose only asset was good organisation. The Romanian Revolution was hijacked by the selfproclaimed National Salvation Front, which was in fact a smokescreen for the moderate wing of the\nCommunist Party. The Front had no real ties to the demonstrating crowds. It was manned by midranking party officials, and led by Ion Iliescu, a former member of the Communist Party\u2019s central\ncommittee and one-time head of the propaganda department. Iliescu and his comrades in the National\nSalvation Front reinvented themselves as democratic politicians, proclaimed to any available\nmicrophone that they were the leaders of the revolution, and then used their long experience and\nnetwork of cronies to take control of the country and pocket its resources.\nIn communist Romania almost everything was owned by the state. Democratic Romania quickly\nprivatised its assets, selling them at bargain prices to the ex-communists, who alone grasped what\nwas happening and collaborated to feather each other\u2019s nests. Government companies that controlled\nnational infrastructure and natural resources were sold to former communist officials at end-of-season\nprices while the party\u2019s foot soldiers bought houses and apartments for pennies.\nIon Iliescu was elected president of Romania, while his colleagues became ministers, parliament\nmembers, bank directors and multimillionaires. The new Romanian elite that controls the country to\nthis day is composed mostly of former communists and their families. The masses who risked their\nnecks in Timi\u015foara and Bucharest settled for scraps, because they did not know how to cooperate and\nhow to create an efficient organisation to look after their own interests.\n21\nA similar fate befell the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. What television did in 1989, Facebook and\nTwitter did in 2011. The new media helped the masses coordinate their activities, so that thousands of\npeople flooded the streets and squares at the right moment and toppled the Mubarak regime.\nHowever, it is one thing to bring 100,000 people to Tahrir Square, and quite another to get a grip on\nthe political machinery, shake the right hands in the right back rooms and run a country effectively.\nConsequently, when Mubarak stepped down the demonstrators could not fill the vacuum. Egypt had\nonly two institutions sufficiently organised to rule the country: the army and the Muslim Brotherhood.\nHence the revolution was hijacked first by the Brotherhood, and eventually by the army.\nThe Romanian ex-communists and the Egyptian generals were not more intelligent or nimble-\nfingered than either the old dictators or the demonstrators in Bucharest and Cairo. Their advantage lay\nin flexible cooperation. They cooperated better than the crowds, and they were willing to show far\nmore flexibility than the hidebound Ceau\u015fescu and Mubarak.\nBeyond Sex and Violence\nIf Sapiens rule the world because we alone can cooperate flexibly in large numbers, then this\nundermines our belief in the sacredness of human beings. We tend to think that we are special, and\ndeserve all kinds of privileges. As proof, we point to the amazing achievements of our species: we\nbuilt the pyramids and the Great Wall of China; we deciphered the structure of atoms and DNA\nmolecules; we reached the South Pole and the moon. If these accomplishments resulted from some\nunique essence that each individual human has \u2013 an immortal soul, say \u2013 then it would make sense to\nsanctify human life. Yet since these triumphs actually result from mass cooperation, it is far less clear\nwhy they should make us revere individual humans.\nA beehive has much greater power than an individual butterfly, yet that doesn\u2019t imply a bee is\ntherefore more hallowed than a butterfly. The Romanian Communist Party successfully dominated the\ndisorganised Romanian population. Does it follow that the life of a party member was more sacred\nthan the life of an ordinary citizen? Humans know how to cooperate far more effectively than\nchimpanzees, which is why humans launch spaceships to the moon whereas chimpanzees throw stones\nat zoo visitors. Does it mean that humans are superior beings?\nWell, maybe. It depends on what enables humans to cooperate so well in the first place. Why are\nhumans alone able to construct such large and sophisticated social systems? Social cooperation\namong most social mammals such as chimpanzees, wolves and dolphins relies on intimate\nacquaintance. Among common chimpanzees, individuals will go hunting together only after they have\ngot to know each other well and established a social hierarchy. Hence chimpanzees spend a lot of\ntime in social interactions and power struggles. When alien chimpanzees meet, they usually cannot\ncooperate, but instead scream at each other, fight or flee as quickly as possible.\nAmong pygmy chimpanzees \u2013 also known as bonobos \u2013 things are a bit different. Bonobos often\nuse sex in order to dispel tensions and cement social bonds. Not surprisingly, homosexual intercourse\nis consequently very common among them. When two alien groups of bonobos encounter one another,\nat first they display fear and hostility, and the jungle is filled with howls and screams. Soon enough,\nhowever, females from one group cross no-chimp\u2019s-land, and invite the strangers to make love\ninstead of war. The invitation is usually accepted, and within a few minutes the potential battlefield\nteems with bonobos having sex in almost every conceivable posture, including hanging upside down\nfrom trees.\nSapiens know these cooperative tricks well. They sometimes form power hierarchies similar to\nthose of common chimpanzees, whereas on other occasions they cement social bonds with sex just\nlike bonobos. Yet personal acquaintance \u2013 whether it involves fighting or copulating \u2013 cannot form\nthe basis for large-scale co-operation. You cannot settle the Greek debt crisis by inviting Greek\npoliticians and German bankers to either a fist fight or an orgy. Research indicates that Sapiens just\ncan\u2019t have intimate relations (whether hostile or amorous) with more than 150 individuals.\n22\nWhatever enables humans to organise mass-cooperation networks, it isn\u2019t intimate relations.\nThis is bad news for psychologists, sociologists, economists and others who try to decipher human\nsociety through laboratory experiments. For both organisational and financial reasons, the vast\nmajority of experiments are conducted either on individuals or on small groups of participants. Yet it\nis risky to extrapolate from small-group behaviour to the dynamics of mass societies. A nation of 100\nmillion people functions in a fundamentally different way to a band of a hundred individuals.\nTake, for example, the Ultimatum Game \u2013 one of the most famous experiments in behavioural\neconomics. This experiment is usually conducted on two people. One of them gets $100, which he\nmust divide between himself and the other participant in any way he wants. He may keep everything,\nsplit the money in half or give most of it away. The other player can do one of two things: accept the\nsuggested division, or reject it outright. If he rejects the division, nobody gets anything.\nClassical economic theories maintain that humans are rational calculating machines. They propose\nthat most people will keep $99, and offer $1 to the other participant. They further propose that the\nother participant will accept the offer. A rational person offered a dollar will always say yes. What\ndoes he care if the other player gets $99?\nClassical economists have probably never left their laboratories and lecture halls to venture into\nthe real world. Most people playing the Ultimatum Game reject very low offers because they are\n\u2018unfair\u2019. They prefer losing a dollar to looking like suckers. Since this is how the real world\nfunctions, few people make very low offers in the first place. Most people divide the money equally,\nor give themselves only a moderate advantage, offering $30 or $40 to the other player.\nThe Ultimatum Game made a significant contribution to undermining classical economic theories\nand to establishing the most important economic discovery of the last few decades: Sapiens don\u2019t\nbehave according to a cold mathematical logic, but rather according to a warm social logic. We are\nruled by emotions. These emotions, as we saw earlier, are in fact sophisticated algorithms that reflect\nthe social mechanisms of ancient hunter-gatherer bands. If 30,000 years ago I helped you hunt a wild\nchicken and you then kept almost all the chicken to yourself, offering me just one wing, I did not say to\nmyself: \u2018Better one wing than nothing at all.\u2019 Instead my evolutionary algorithms kicked in, adrenaline\nand testosterone flooded my system, my blood boiled, and I stamped my feet and shouted at the top of\nmy voice. In the short term I may have gone hungry, and even risked a punch or two. But it paid off in\nthe long term, because you thought twice before ripping me off again. We refuse unfair offers because\npeople who meekly accepted unfair offers didn\u2019t survive in the Stone Age.\nObservations of contemporary hunter-gatherer bands support this idea. Most bands are highly\negalitarian, and when a hunter comes back to camp carrying a fat deer, everybody gets a share. The\nsame is true of chimpanzees. When one chimp kills a piglet, the other troop members will gather\nround him with outstretched hands, and usually they all get a piece.\nIn another recent experiment, the primatologist Frans de Waal placed two capuchin monkeys in two\nadjacent cages, so that each could see everything the other was doing. De Waal and his colleagues\nplaced small stones inside each cage, and trained the monkeys to give them these stones. Whenever a\nmonkey handed over a stone, he received food in exchange. At first the reward was a piece of\ncucumber. Both monkeys were very pleased with that, and happily ate their cucumber. After a few\nrounds de Waal moved to the next stage of the experiment. This time, when the first monkey\nsurrendered a stone, he got a grape. Grapes are much more tasty than cucumbers. However, when the\nsecond monkey gave a stone, he still received a piece of cucumber. The second monkey, who was\npreviously very happy with his cucumber, became incensed. He took the cucumber, looked at it in\ndisbelief for a moment, and then threw it at the scientists in anger and began jumping and screeching\nloudly. He ain\u2019t a sucker.\n23\nThis hilarious experiment (which you can see for yourself on YouTube), along with the Ultimatum\nGame, has led many to believe that primates have a natural morality, and that equality is a universal\nand timeless value. People are egalitarian by nature, and unequal societies can never function well\ndue to resentment and dissatisfaction.\nBut is that really so? These theories may work well on chimpanzees, capuchin monkeys and small\nhunter-gatherer bands. They also work well in the lab, where you test them on small groups of people.\nYet once you observe the behaviour of human masses you discover a completely different reality.\nMost human kingdoms and empires were extremely unequal, yet many of them were surprisingly\nstable and efficient. In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh sprawled on comfortable cushions inside a cool and\nsumptuous palace, wearing golden sandals and gem-studded tunics, while beautiful maids popped\nsweet grapes into his mouth. Through the open window he could see the peasants in the fields, toiling\nin dirty rags under a merciless sun, and blessed was the peasant who had a cucumber to eat at the end\nof the day. Yet the peasants rarely revolted.\nIn 1740 King Frederick II of Prussia invaded Silesia, thus commencing a series of bloody wars that\nearned him his sobriquet Frederick the Great, turned Prussia into a major power and left hundreds of\nthousands of people dead, crippled or destitute. Most of Frederick\u2019s soldiers were hapless recruits,\nsubject to iron discipline and draconian drill. Not surprisingly, the soldiers lost little love on their\nsupreme commander. As Frederick watched his troops assemble for the invasion, he told one of his\ngenerals that what struck him most about the scene was that \u2018we are standing here in perfect safety,\nlooking at 60,000 men \u2013 they are all our enemies, and there is not one of them who is not better armed\nand stronger than we are, and yet they all tremble in our presence, while we have no reason\nwhatsoever to be afraid of them\u2019.\n24 Frederick could indeed watch them in perfect safety. During the\nfollowing years, despite all the hardships of war, these 60,000 armed men never revolted against him\n\u2013 indeed, many of them served him with exceptional courage, risking and even sacrificing their very\nlives.\nWhy did the Egyptian peasants and Prussian soldiers act so differently than we would have\nexpected on the basis of the Ultimatum Game and the capuchin monkeys experiment? Because large\nnumbers of people behave in a fundamentally different way than do small numbers. What would\nscientists see if they conducted the Ultimatum Game experiment on two groups of 1 million people\neach, who had to share $100 billion?\nThey would probably have witnessed strange and fascinating dynamics. For example, since 1\nmillion people cannot make decisions collectively, each group might sprout a small ruling elite. What\nif one elite offers the other $10 billion, keeping $90 billion? The leaders of the second group might\nwell accept this unfair offer, siphon most of the $10 billion into their Swiss bank accounts, while\npreventing rebellion among their followers with a combination of sticks and carrots. The leadership\nmight threaten to severely punish dissidents forthwith, while promising the meek and patient\neverlasting rewards in the afterlife. This is what happened in ancient Egypt and eighteenth-century\nPrussia, and this is how things still work out in numerous countries around the world.\nSuch threats and promises often succeed in creating stable human hierarchies and mass-cooperation\nnetworks, as long as people believe that they reflect the inevitable laws of nature or the divine\ncommands of God, rather than just human whims. All large-scale human cooperation is ultimately\nbased on our belief in imagined orders. These are sets of rules that, despite existing only in our\nimagination, we believe to be as real and inviolable as gravity. \u2018If you sacrifice ten bulls to the sky\ngod, the rain will come; if you honour your parents, you will go to heaven; and if you don\u2019t believe\nwhat I am telling you \u2013 you\u2019ll go to hell.\u2019 As long as all Sapiens living in a particular locality believe\nin the same stories, they all follow the same rules, making it easy to predict the behaviour of strangers\nand to organise mass-cooperation networks. Sapiens often use visual marks such as a turban, a beard\nor a business suit to signal \u2018you can trust me, I believe in the same story as you\u2019. Our chimpanzee\ncousins cannot invent and spread such stories, which is why they cannot cooperate in large numbers.\nThe Web of Meaning\nPeople find it difficult to understand the idea of \u2018imagined orders\u2019 because they assume that there are\nonly two types of realities: objective realities and subjective realities. In objective reality, things\nexist independently of our beliefs and feelings. Gravity, for example, is an objective reality. It existed\nlong before Newton, and it affects people who don\u2019t believe in it just as much as it affects those who\ndo.\nSubjective reality, in contrast, depends on my personal beliefs and feelings. Thus, suppose I feel a\nsharp pain in my head and go to the doctor. The doctor checks me thoroughly, but finds nothing wrong.\nSo she sends me for a blood test, urine test, DNA test, X-ray, electrocardiogram, fMRI scan and a\nplethora of other procedures. When the results come in she announces that I am perfectly healthy, and\nI can go home. Yet I still feel a sharp pain in my head. Even though every objective test has found\nnothing wrong with me, and even though nobody except me feels the pain, for me the pain is 100 per\ncent real.\nMost people presume that reality is either objective or subjective, and that there is no third option.\nHence once they satisfy themselves that something isn\u2019t just their own subjective feeling, they jump to\nthe conclusion it must be objective. If lots of people believe in God; if money makes the world go\nround; and if nationalism starts wars and builds empires \u2013 then these things aren\u2019t just a subjective\nbelief of mine. God, money and nations must therefore be objective realities.\nHowever, there is a third level of reality: the intersubjective level. Intersubjective entities depend\non communication among many humans rather than on the beliefs and feelings of individual humans.\nMany of the most important agents in history are intersubjective. Money, for example, has no\nobjective value. You cannot eat, drink or wear a dollar bill. Yet as long as billions of people believe\nin its value, you can use it to buy food, beverages and clothing. If the baker suddenly loses his faith in\nthe dollar bill and refuses to give me a loaf of bread for this green piece of paper, it doesn\u2019t matter\nmuch. I can just go down a few blocks to the nearby supermarket. However, if the supermarket\ncashiers also refuse to accept this piece of paper, along with the hawkers in the market and the\nsalespeople in the mall, then the dollar will lose its value. The green pieces of paper will go on\nexisting, of course, but they will be worthless.\nSuch things actually happen from time to time. On 3 November 1985 the Myanmar government\nunexpectedly announced that bank-notes of twenty-five, fifty and a hundred kyats were no longer legal\ntender. People were given no opportunity to exchange the notes, and savings of a lifetime were\ninstantaneously turned into heaps of worthless paper. To replace the defunct notes, the government\nintroduced new seventy-five-kyat bills, allegedly in honour of the seventy-fifth birthday of Myanmar\u2019s\ndictator, General Ne Win. In August 1986, banknotes of fifteen kyats and thirty-five kyats were issued.\nRumour had it that the dictator, who had a strong faith in numerology, believed that fifteen and thirtyfive are lucky numbers. They brought little luck to his subjects. On 5 September 1987 the government\nsuddenly decreed that all thirty-five and seventy-five notes were no longer money.\nThe value of money is not the only thing that might evaporate once people stop believing in it. The\nsame can happen to laws, gods and even entire empires. One moment they are busy shaping the world,\nand the next moment they no longer exist. Zeus and Hera were once important powers in the\nMediterranean basin, but today they lack any authority because nobody believes in them. The Soviet\nUnion could once destroy the entire human race, yet it ceased to exist at the stroke of a pen. At 2 p.m.\non 8 December 1991, in a state dacha near Viskuli, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed\nthe Belavezha Accords, which stated that \u2018We, the Republic of Belarus, the Russian Federation and\nUkraine, as founding states of the USSR that signed the union treaty of 1922, hereby establish that the\nUSSR as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality ceases its existence.\u2019\n25 And that was\nthat. No more Soviet Union.\nIt is relatively easy to accept that money is an intersubjective reality. Most people are also happy\nto acknowledge that ancient Greek gods, evil empires and the values of alien cultures exist only in the\nimagination. Yet we don\u2019t want to accept that our God, our nation or our values are mere fictions,\nbecause these are the things that give meaning to our lives. We want to believe that our lives have\nsome objective meaning, and that our sacrifices matter to something beyond the stories in our head.\nYet in truth the lives of most people have meaning only within the network of stories they tell one\nanother.\nSigning the Belavezha Accords. Pen touches paper \u2013 and abracadabra! The Soviet Union disappears.\n\u00a9 NOVOSTI/AFP/Getty Images.\nMeaning is created when many people weave together a common network of stories. Why does a\nparticular action \u2013 such as getting married in church, fasting on Ramadan or voting on election day \u2013\nseem meaningful to me? Because my parents also think it is meaningful, as do my brothers, my\nneighbours, people in nearby cities and even the residents of far-off countries. And why do all these\npeople think it is meaningful? Because their friends and neighbours also share the same view. People\nconstantly reinforce each other\u2019s beliefs in a self-perpetuating loop. Each round of mutual\nconfirmation tightens the web of meaning further, until you have little choice but to believe what\neveryone else believes.\nYet over decades and centuries the web of meaning unravels and a new web is spun in its place. To\nstudy history means to watch the spinning and unravelling of these webs, and to realise that what\nseems to people in one age the most important thing in life becomes utterly meaningless to their\ndescendants.\nIn 1187 Saladin defeated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin and conquered Jerusalem. In\nresponse the Pope launched the Third Crusade to recapture the holy city. Imagine a young English\nnobleman named John, who left home to fight Saladin. John believed that his actions had an objective\nmeaning. He believed that if he died on the crusade, after death his soul would ascend to heaven,\nwhere it would enjoy everlasting celestial joy. He would have been horrified to learn that the soul\nand heaven are just stories invented by humans. John wholeheartedly believed that if he reached the\nHoly Land, and if some Muslim warrior with a big moustache brought an axe down on his head, he\nwould feel an unbearable pain, his ears would ring, his legs would crumble under him, his field of\nvision would turn black \u2013 and the very next moment he would see brilliant light all around him, he\nwould hear angelic voices and melodious harps, and radiant winged cherubs would beckon him\nthrough a magnificent golden gate.\nJohn had a very strong faith in all this, because he was enmeshed within an extremely dense and\npowerful web of meaning. His earliest memories were of Grandpa Henry\u2019s rusty sword, hanging in\nthe castle\u2019s main hall. Ever since he was a toddler John had heard stories of Grandpa Henry who died\non the Second Crusade and who is now resting with the angels in heaven, watching over John and his\nfamily. When minstrels visited the castle, they usually sang about the brave crusaders who fought in\nthe Holy Land. When John went to church, he enjoyed looking at the stained-glass windows. One\nshowed Godfrey of Bouillon riding a horse and impaling a wicked-looking Muslim on his lance.\nAnother showed the souls of sinners burning in hell. John listened attentively to the local priest, the\nmost learned man he knew. Almost every Sunday, the priest explained \u2013 with the help of well-crafted\nparables and hilarious jokes \u2013 that there was no salvation outside the Catholic Church, that the Pope\nin Rome was our holy father and that we always had to obey his commands. If we murdered or stole,\nGod would send us to hell; but if we killed infidel Muslims, God would welcome us to heaven.\nOne day when John was just turning eighteen a dishevelled knight rode to the castle\u2019s gate, and in a\nchoked voice announced the news: Saladin has destroyed the crusader army at Hattin! Jerusalem has\nfallen! The Pope has declared a new crusade, promising eternal salvation to anyone who dies on it!\nAll around, people looked shocked and worried, but John\u2019s face lit up in an otherworldly glow and\nhe proclaimed: \u2018I am going to fight the infidels and liberate the Holy Land!\u2019 Everyone fell silent for a\nmoment, and then smiles and tears appeared on their faces. His mother wiped her eyes, gave John a\nbig hug and told him how proud she was of him. His father gave him a mighty pat on the back, and\nsaid: \u2018If only I was your age, son, I would join you. Our family\u2019s honour is at stake \u2013 I am sure you\nwon\u2019t disappoint us!\u2019 Two of his friends announced that they were coming too. Even John\u2019s sworn\nrival, the baron on the other side of the river, paid a visit to wish him Godspeed.\nAs he left the castle, villagers came forth from their hovels to wave to him, and all the pretty girls\nlooked longingly at the brave crusader setting off to fight the infidels. When he set sail from England\nand made his way through strange and distant lands \u2013 Normandy, Provence, Sicily \u2013 he was joined by\nbands of foreign knights, all with the same destination and the same faith. When the army finally\ndisembarked in the Holy Land and waged battle with Saladin\u2019s hosts, John was amazed to discover\nthat even the wicked Saracens shared his beliefs. True, they were a bit confused, thinking that the\nChristians were the infidels and that the Muslims were obeying God\u2019s will. Yet they too accepted the\nbasic principle that those fighting for God and Jerusalem will go straight to heaven when they die.\nIn such a way, thread by thread, medieval civilisation spun its web of meaning, trapping John and\nhis contemporaries like flies. It was inconceivable to John that all these stories were just figments of\nthe imagination. Maybe his parents and uncles were wrong. But the minstrels too, and all his friends,\nand the village girls, the learned priest, the baron on the other side of the river, the Pope in Rome, the\nProven\u00e7al and Sicilian knights, and even the very Muslims \u2013 is it possible that they were all\nhallucinating?\nAnd the years pass. As the historian watches, the web of meaning unravels and another is spun in\nits stead. John\u2019s parents die, followed by all his siblings and friends. Instead of minstrels singing\nabout the crusades, the new fashion is stage plays about tragic love affairs. The family castle burns to\nthe ground and, when it is rebuilt, no trace is found of Grandpa Henry\u2019s sword. The church windows\nshatter in a winter storm and the replacement glass no longer depicts Godfrey of Bouillon and the\nsinners in hell, but rather the great triumph of the king of England over the king of France. The local\npriest has stopped calling the Pope \u2018our holy father\u2019 \u2013 he is now referred to as \u2018that devil in Rome\u2019.\nIn the nearby university scholars pore over ancient Greek manuscripts, dissect dead bodies and\nwhisper quietly behind closed doors that perhaps there is no such thing as the soul.\nAnd the years continue to pass. Where the castle once stood, there is now a shopping mall. In the\nlocal cinema they are screening Monty Python and the Holy Grail for the umpteenth time. In an\nempty church a bored vicar is overjoyed to see two Japanese tourists. He explains at length about the\nstained-glass windows, while they politely smile, nodding in complete incomprehension. On the steps\noutside a gaggle of teenagers are playing with their iPhones. They watch a new YouTube remix of\nJohn Lennon\u2019s \u2018Imagine\u2019. \u2018Imagine there\u2019s no heaven,\u2019 sings Lennon, \u2018it\u2019s easy if you try.\u2019 A Pakistani\nstreet cleaner is sweeping the pavement, while a nearby radio broadcasts the news: the carnage in\nSyria continues, and the Security Council\u2019s meeting has ended in an impasse. Suddenly a hole in time\nopens, a mysterious ray of light illuminates the face of one of the teenagers, who announces: \u2018I am\ngoing to fight the infidels and liberate the Holy Land!\u2019\nInfidels and Holy Land? These words no longer carry any meaning for most people in today\u2019s\nEngland. Even the vicar would probably think the teenager is having some sort of psychotic episode.\nIn contrast, if an English youth decided to join Amnesty International and travel to Syria to protect the\nhuman rights of refugees, he will be seen as a hero. In the Middle Ages people would have thought he\nhad gone bonkers. Nobody in twelfth-century England knew what human rights were. You want to\ntravel to the Middle East and risk your life not in order to kill Muslims, but to protect one group of\nMuslims from another? You must be out of your mind.\nThat\u2019s how history unfolds. People weave a web of meaning, believe in it with all their heart, but\nsooner or later the web unravels, and when we look back we cannot understand how anybody could\nhave taken it seriously. With hindsight, going on crusade in the hope of reaching Paradise sounds like\nutter madness. With hindsight, the Cold War seems even madder. How come thirty years ago people\nwere willing to risk nuclear holocaust because of their belief in a communist paradise? A hundred\nyears hence, our belief in democracy and human rights might look equally incomprehensible to our\ndescendants.\nDreamtime\nSapiens rule the world because only they can weave an intersubjective web of meaning: a web of\nlaws, forces, entities and places that exist purely in their common imagination. This web allows\nhumans alone to organise crusades, socialist revolutions and human rights movements.\nOther animals may also imagine various things. A cat waiting to ambush a mouse might not see the\nmouse, but may well imagine the shape and even taste of the mouse. Yet to the best of our knowledge,\ncats are able to imagine only things that actually exist in the world, like mice. They cannot imagine\nthings that they have never seen or smelled or tasted \u2013 such as the US dollar, Google corporation or\nthe European Union. Only Sapiens can imagine such chimeras.\nConsequently, whereas cats and other animals are confined to the objective realm and use their\ncommunication systems merely to describe reality, Sapiens use language to create completely new\nrealities. During the last 70,000 years the intersubjective realities that Sapiens invented became ever\nmore powerful, so that today they dominate the world. Will the chimpanzees, the elephants, the\nAmazon rainforests and the Arctic glaciers survive the twenty-first century? This depends on the\nwishes and decisions of intersubjective entities such as the European Union and the World Bank;\nentities that exist only in our shared imagination.\nNo other animal can stand up to us, not because they lack a soul or a mind, but because they lack\nthe necessary imagination. Lions can run, jump, claw and bite. Yet they cannot open a bank account or\nfile a lawsuit. And in the twenty-first century, a banker who knows how to file a lawsuit is far more\npowerful than the most ferocious lion in the savannah.\nAs well as separating humans from other animals, this ability to create intersubjective entities also\nseparates the humanities from the life sciences. Historians seek to understand the development of\nintersubjective entities like gods and nations, whereas biologists hardly recognise the existence of\nsuch things. Some believe that if we could only crack the genetic code and map every neuron in the\nbrain, we will know all of humanity\u2019s secrets. After all, if humans have no soul, and if thoughts,\nemotions and sensations are just biochemical algorithms, why can\u2019t biology account for all the\nvagaries of human societies? From this perspective, the crusades were territorial disputes shaped by\nevolutionary pressures, and English knights going to fight Saladin in the Holy Land were not that\ndifferent from wolves trying to appropriate the territory of a neighbouring pack.\nThe humanities, in contrast, emphasise the crucial importance of intersubjective entities, which\ncannot be reduced to hormones and neurons. To think historically means to ascribe real power to the\ncontents of our imaginary stories. Of course, historians don\u2019t ignore objective factors such as climate\nchanges and genetic mutations, but they give much greater importance to the stories people invent and\nbelieve. North Korea and South Korea are so different from one another not because people in\nPyongyang have different genes to people in Seoul, or because the north is colder and more\nmountainous. It\u2019s because the north is dominated by very different fictions.\nMaybe someday breakthroughs in neurobiology will enable us to explain communism and the\ncrusades in strictly biochemical terms. Yet we are very far from that point. During the twenty-first\ncentury the border between history and biology is likely to blur not because we will discover\nbiological explanations for historical events, but rather because ideological fictions will rewrite\nDNA strands; political and economic interests will redesign the climate; and the geography of\nmountains and rivers will give way to cyberspace. As human fictions are translated into genetic and\nelectronic codes, the intersubjective reality will swallow up the objective reality and biology will\nmerge with history. In the twenty-first century fiction might thereby become the most potent force on\nearth, surpassing even wayward asteroids and natural selection. Hence if we want to understand our\nfuture, cracking genomes and crunching numbers is hardly enough. We must also decipher the fictions\nthat give meaning to the world.\nThe Creator:Jackson Pollock in a moment of inspiration.\nRudy Burckhardt, photographer.

On the one hand, they are familiar\nwith objective entities outside them, such as trees, rocks and rivers. On the other hand, they are aware\nof subjective experiences within them, such as fear, joy and desire. Sapiens, in contrast, live in triplelayered reality. In addition to trees, rivers, fears and desires, the Sapiens world also contains stories\nabout money, gods, nations and corporations. As history unfolded, the impact of gods, nations and\ncorporations grew at the expense of rivers, fears and desires. There are still many rivers in the world,\nand people are still motivated by their fears and wishes, but Jesus Christ, the French Republic and\nApple Inc. have dammed and harnessed the rivers, and have learned to shape our deepest anxieties\nand yearnings.\nSince new twenty-first-century technologies are likely to make such fictions only more potent,\nunderstanding our future requires understanding how stories about Christ, France and Apple have\ngained so much power. Humans think they make history, but history actually revolves around the web\nof stories. The basic abilities of individual humans have not changed much since the Stone Age. But\nthe web of stories has grown from strength to strength, thereby pushing history from the Stone Age to\nthe Silicon Age.\nIt all began about 70,000 years ago, when the Cognitive Revolution enabled Sapiens to start talking\nabout things that existed only in their own imagination. For the following 60,000 years Sapiens wove\nmany fictional webs, but these remained small and local. The spirit of a revered ancestor worshipped\nby one tribe was completely unknown to its neighbours, and seashells valuable in one locality\nbecame worthless once you crossed the nearby mountain range. Stories about ancestral spirits and\nprecious seashells still gave Sapiens a huge advantage, because they allowed hundreds and\nsometimes even thousands of Sapiens to cooperate effectively, which was far more than Neanderthals\nor chimpanzees could do. Yet as long as Sapiens remained hunter-gatherers, they could not cooperate\non a truly massive scale, because it was impossible to feed a city or a kingdom by hunting and\ngathering. Consequently the spirits, fairies and demons of the Stone Age were relatively weak\nentities.\nThe Agricultural Revolution, which began about 12,000 years ago, provided the necessary material\nbase for enlarging and strengthening the intersubjective networks. Farming made it possible to feed\nthousands of people in crowded cities and thousands of soldiers in disciplined armies. However, the\nintersubjective webs then encountered a new obstacle. In order to preserve the collective myths and\norganise mass cooperation, the early farmers relied on the data-processing abilities of the human\nbrain, which were strictly limited.\nFarmers believed in stories about great gods. They built temples to their favourite god, held\nfestivals in his honour, offered him sacrifices, and gave him lands, tithes and presents. In the first\ncities of ancient Sumer, about 6,000 years ago, the temples were not just centres of worship, but also\nthe most important political and economic hubs. The Sumerian gods fulfilled a function analogous to\nmodern brands and corporations. Today, corporations are fictional legal entities that own property,\nlend money, hire employees and initiate economic enterprises. In ancient Uruk, Lagash and Shurupak\nthe gods functioned as legal entities that could own fields and slaves, give and receive loans, pay\nsalaries and build dams and canals.\nSince the gods never died, and since they had no children to fight over their inheritance, they\ngathered more and more property and power. An increasing number of Sumerians found themselves\nemployed by the gods, taking loans from the gods, tilling the gods\u2019 lands and owing taxes and tithes to\nthe gods. Just as in present-day San Francisco John is employed by Google while Mary works for\nMicrosoft, so in ancient Uruk one person was employed by the great god Enki while his neighbour\nworked for the goddess Inanna. The temples of Enki and Inanna dominated the Uruk skyline, and their\ndivine logos branded buildings, products and clothes. For the Sumerians, Enki and Inanna were as\nreal as Google and Microsoft are real for us. Compared to their predecessors \u2013 the ghosts and spirits\nof the Stone Age \u2013 the Sumerian gods were very powerful entities.\nIt goes without saying that the gods didn\u2019t actually run their businesses, for the simple reason that\nthey didn\u2019t exist anywhere except in the human imagination. Day-to-day activities were managed by\nthe temple priests (just as Google and Microsoft need to hire flesh-and-blood humans to manage their\naffairs). However, as the gods acquired more and more property and power, the priests could not\ncope. They may have represented the mighty sky god or the all-knowing earth goddess, but they\nthemselves were fallible mortals. They had difficulty remembering all the lands belonging to the\ngoddess Inanna, which of Inanna\u2019s employees had received their salary already, which of the\ngoddess\u2019s tenants had failed to pay rent and what interest rate the goddess charged her debtors. This\nwas one of the main reasons why in Sumer, like everywhere else around the world, human\ncooperation networks could not grow much even thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution.\nThere were no huge kingdoms, no extensive trade networks and no universal religions.\nThis obstacle was finally removed about 5,000 years ago, when the Sumerians invented both\nwriting and money. These Siamese twins \u2013 born to the same parents at the same time and in the same\nplace \u2013 broke the data-processing limitations of the human brain. Writing and money made it possible\nto start collecting taxes from hundreds of thousands of people, to organise complex bureaucracies and\nto establish vast kingdoms. In Sumer these kingdoms were managed in the name of the gods by human\npriest-kings. In the neighbouring Nile Valley people went a step further, merging the priest-king with\nthe god to create a living deity \u2013 pharaoh.\nThe Egyptians considered pharaoh to be an actual god rather than just a divine deputy. The whole\nof Egypt belonged to that god, and all people had to obey his orders and pay his taxes. Just as in the\nSumerian temples, so also in pharaonic Egypt the god didn\u2019t manage his business empire by himself.\nSome pharaohs ruled with an iron fist, while others passed their days at banquets and festivities, but\nin both cases the practical work of administering Egypt was left to thousands of literate officials. Just\nlike any other human, pharaoh had a biological body with biological needs, desires and emotions. But\nthe biological pharaoh was of little importance. The real ruler of the Nile Valley was an imagined\npharaoh that existed in the stories millions of Egyptians told one another.\nWhile pharaoh sat in his palace in the capital city of Memphis, eating grapes and dallying with his\nwives and mistresses, pharaoh\u2019s officials criss-crossed the kingdom from the Mediterranean shore to\nthe Nubian Desert. The bureaucrats calculated the taxes each village had to pay, wrote them on long\npapyrus scrolls and sent them to Memphis. When a written order came from Memphis to recruit\nsoldiers to the army or labourers for some construction project, the officials gathered the necessary\nmen. They computed how many kilograms of wheat the royal granaries contained, how many work\ndays were required to clean the canals and reservoirs, and how many ducks and pigs to send to\nMemphis so that pharaoh\u2019s harem could dine well. Even when the living deity died, and his body was\nembalmed and borne in an extravagant funerary procession to the royal necropolis outside Memphis,\nthe bureaucracy kept going. The officials kept writing scrolls, collecting taxes, sending orders and\noiling the gears of the pharaonic machine.\nIf the Sumerian gods remind us of present-day company brands, so the living-god pharaoh can be\ncompared to modern personal brands such as Elvis Presley, Madonna or Justin Bieber. Just like\npharaoh, Elvis too had a biological body, complete with biological needs, desires and emotions.\nElvis ate and drank and slept. Yet Elvis was much more than a biological body. Like pharaoh, Elvis\nwas a story, a myth, a brand \u2013 and the brand was far more important than the biological body. During\nElvis\u2019s lifetime, the brand earned millions of dollars selling records, tickets, posters and rights, but\nonly a small fraction of the necessary work was done by Elvis in person. Instead, most of it was done\nby a small army of agents, lawyers, producers and secretaries. Consequently when the biological\nElvis died, for the brand it was business as usual. Even today fans still buy the King\u2019s posters and\nalbums, radio stations go on paying royalties, and more than half a million pilgrims flock each year to\nGraceland, the King\u2019s necropolis in Memphis, Tennessee.\nBrands are not a modern invention. Just like Elvis Presley, pharaoh too was a brand rather than a living organism. For millions of\nfollowers his image counted for far more than his fleshy reality, and they kept worshipping him long after he was dead.\nLeft: \u00a9 Richard Nowitz/Getty Images. Right: \u00a9 Archive Photos/Stringer/Getty Images.\nPrior to the invention of writing, stories were confined by the limited capacity of human brains.\nYou couldn\u2019t invent overly complex stories which people couldn\u2019t remember. With writing you could\nsuddenly create extremely long and intricate stories, which were stored on tablets and papyri rather\nthan in human heads. No ancient Egyptian remembered all of pharaoh\u2019s lands, taxes and tithes; Elvis\nPresley never even read all the contracts signed in his name; no living soul is familiar with all the\nlaws and regulations of the European Union; and no banker or CIA agent tracks down every dollar in\nthe world. Yet all of these minutiae are written somewhere, and the assemblage of relevant documents\ndefines the identity and power of pharaoh, Elvis, the EU and the dollar.\nWriting has thus enabled humans to organise entire societies in an algorithmic fashion. We\nencountered the term \u2018algorithm\u2019 when we tried to understand what emotions are and how brains\nfunction, and defined it as a methodical set of steps that can be used to make calculations, resolve\nproblems and reach decisions. In illiterate societies people make all calculations and decisions in\ntheir heads. In literate societies people are organised into networks, so that each person is only a\nsmall step in a huge algorithm, and it is the algorithm as a whole that makes the important decisions.\nThis is the essence of bureaucracy.\nThink about a modern hospital, for example. When you arrive the receptionist hands you a standard\nform, and asks you a predetermined set of questions. Your answers are forwarded to a nurse, who\ncompares them with the hospital\u2019s regulations in order to decide what preliminary tests to give you.\nShe then measures, say, your blood pressure and heart rate, and takes a blood test. The doctor on duty\nexamines the results, and follows a strict protocol to decide in which ward to hospitalise you. In the\nward you are subjected to much more thorough examinations, such as an X-ray or an fMRI scan,\nmandated by thick medical guidebooks. Specialists then analyse the results according to well-known\nstatistical databases, deciding what medicines to give you or what further tests to run.\nThis algorithmic structure ensures that it doesn\u2019t really matter who is the receptionist, nurse or\ndoctor on duty. Their personality type, their political opinions and their momentary moods are\nirrelevant. As long as they all follow the regulations and protocols, they have a good chance of curing\nyou. According to the algorithmic ideal, your fate is in the hands of \u2018the system\u2019, and not in the hands\nof the flesh-and-blood mortals who happen to man this or that post.\nWhat\u2019s true of hospitals is also true of armies, prisons, schools, corporations \u2013 and ancient\nkingdoms. Of course ancient Egypt was far less technologically sophisticated than a modern hospital,\nbut the algorithmic principle was the same. In ancient Egypt too, most decisions were made not by a\nsingle wise person, but by a network of officials linked together through papyri and stone\ninscriptions. Acting in the name of the living-god pharaoh, the network restructured human society and\nreshaped the natural world. For example, pharaohs Senusret III and his son Amenemhat III, who ruled\nEgypt from 1878 BC to 1814 BC, dug a huge canal linking the Nile to the swamps of the Fayum Valley.\nAn intricate system of dams, reservoirs and subsidiary canals diverted some of the Nile waters to\nFayum, creating an immense artificial lake holding 50 billion cubic metres of water.\n1 By comparison,\nLake Mead, the largest man-made reservoir in the United States (formed by the Hoover Dam), holds\nat most 35 billion cubic metres of water.\nThe Fayum engineering project gave pharaoh the power to regulate the Nile, prevent destructive\nfloods and provide precious water relief in times of drought. In addition, it turned the Fayum Valley\nfrom a crocodile-infested swamp surrounded by barren desert into Egypt\u2019s granary. A new city called\nShedet was built on the shore of the new artificial lake. The Greeks called it Crocodilopolis \u2013 the\ncity of crocodiles. It was dominated by the temple of the crocodile god Sobek, who was identified\nwith pharaoh (contemporary statues sometimes show pharaoh sporting a crocodile head). The temple\nhoused a sacred crocodile called Petsuchos, who was considered the living incarnation of Sobek.\nJust like the living-god pharaoh, the living-god Petsuchos was lovingly groomed by the attending\npriests, who provided the lucky reptile with lavish food and even toys, and dressed him up in gold\ncloaks and gem-encrusted crowns. After all, Petsuchos was the priests\u2019 brand, and their authority and\nlivelihood depended on him. When Petsuchos died, a new crocodile was immediately elected to fill\nhis sandals, while the dead reptile was carefully embalmed and mummified.\nIn the days of Senusret III and Amenemhat III the Egyptians had neither bulldozers nor dynamite.\nThey didn\u2019t even have iron tools, work horses or wheels (the wheel did not enter common usage in\nEgypt until about 1500 BC). Bronze tools were considered cutting-edge technology, but they were so\nexpensive and rare that most of the building work was done only with tools made of stone and wood,\noperated by human muscle power. Many people argue that the great building projects of ancient Egypt\n\u2013 all the dams and reservoirs and pyramids \u2013 must have been built by aliens from outer space. How\nelse could a culture lacking even wheels and iron accomplish such wonders?\nThe truth is very different. Egyptians built Lake Fayum and the pyramids not thanks to\nextraterrestrial help, but thanks to superb organisational skills. Relying on thousands of literate\nbureaucrats, pharaoh recruited tens of thousands of labourers and enough food to maintain them for\nyears on end. When tens of thousands of labourers cooperate for several decades, they can build an\nartificial lake or a pyramid even with stone tools.\nPharaoh himself hardly lifted a finger, of course. He didn\u2019t collect taxes himself, he didn\u2019t draw\nany architectural plans, and he certainly never picked up a shovel. But the Egyptians believed that\nonly prayers to the living-god pharaoh and to his heavenly patron Sobek could save the Nile Valley\nfrom devastating floods and droughts. They were right. Pharaoh and Sobek were imaginary entities\nthat did nothing to raise or lower the Nile water level, but when millions of people believed in\npharaoh and Sobek and therefore cooperated to build dams and dig canals, floods and droughts\nbecame rare. Compared to the Sumerian gods, not to mention the Stone Age spirits, the gods of\nancient Egypt were truly powerful entities that founded cities, raised armies and controlled the lives\nof millions of humans, cows and crocodiles.\nIt may sound strange to credit imaginary entities with building or controlling things. But nowadays\nwe habitually say that the United States built the first nuclear bomb, that China built the Three Gorges\nDam or that Google is building an autonomous car. Why not say, then, that pharaoh built a reservoir\nand Sobek dug a canal?\nLiving on Paper\nWriting thus facilitated the appearance of powerful fictional entities that organised millions of people\nand reshaped the reality of rivers, swamps and crocodiles. Simultaneously, writing also made it\neasier for humans to believe in the existence of such fictional entities, because it habituated people to\nexperiencing reality through the mediation of abstract symbols.\nHunter-gatherers spent their days climbing trees, looking for mushrooms, and chasing boars and\nrabbits. Their daily reality consisted of trees, mushrooms, boars and rabbits. Peasants worked all day\nin the fields, ploughing, harvesting, grinding corn and taking care of farmyard animals. Their daily\nreality was the feeling of muddy earth under bare feet, the smell of oxen pulling the plough and the\ntaste of warm bread fresh from the oven. In contrast, scribes in ancient Egypt devoted most of their\ntime to reading, writing and calculating. Their daily reality consisted of ink marks on papyrus scrolls,\nwhich determined who owned which field, how much an ox cost and what yearly taxes peasants had\nto pay. A scribe could decide the fate of an entire village with a stroke of his stylus.\nThe vast majority of people remained illiterate until the modern age, but the all-important\nadministrators increasingly saw reality through the medium of written texts. For this literate elite \u2013\nwhether in ancient Egypt or in twentieth-century Europe \u2013 anything written on a piece of paper was at\nleast as real as trees, oxen and human beings.\nWhen the Nazis overran France in the spring of 1940, much of its Jewish population tried to escape\nthe country. In order to cross the border south, they needed visas to Spain and Portugal, and tens of\nthousands of Jews, along with many other refugees, besieged the Portuguese consulate in Bordeaux in\na desperate attempt to get the life-saving piece of paper. The Portuguese government forbade its\nconsuls in France to issue visas without prior approval from the Foreign Ministry, but the consul in\nBordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, decided to disregard the order, throwing to the wind a thirtyyear diplomatic career. As Nazi tanks were closing in on Bordeaux, Sousa Mendes and his team\nworked around the clock for ten days and nights, barely stopping to sleep, just issuing visas and\nstamping pieces of paper. Sousa Mendes issued thousands of visas before collapsing from exhaustion.\nThe Portuguese government \u2013 which had little desire to accept any of these refugees \u2013 sent agents\nto escort the disobedient consul back home, and fired him from the foreign office. Yet officials who\ncared little for the plight of human beings nevertheless had deep respect for documents, and the visas\nSousa Mendes issued against orders were respected by French, Spanish and Portuguese bureaucrats\nalike, spiriting up to 30,000 people out of the Nazi death trap. Sousa Mendes, armed with little more\nthan a rubber stamp, was responsible for the largest rescue operation by a single individual during the\nHolocaust.\n2\nAristides de Sousa Mendes, the angel with the rubber stamp.\nCourtesy of the Sousa Mendes Foundation.\nThe sanctity of written records often had far less positive effects. From 1958 to 1961 communist\nChina undertook the Great Leap Forward, when Mao Zedong wished to rapidly turn China into a\nsuperpower. Mao ordered the doubling and tripling of agricultural production, using the surplus\nproduce to finance ambitious industrial and military projects. Mao\u2019s impossible demands made their\nway down the bureaucratic ladder, from the government offices in Beijing, through provincial\nadministrators, all the way to the village headmen. The local officials, afraid of voicing any criticism\nand wishing to curry favour with their superiors, concocted imaginary reports of dramatic increases\nin agricultural output. As the fabricated numbers made their way up the bureaucratic hierarchy, each\nofficial only exaggerated them further, adding a zero here or there with a stroke of a pen.\nOne of the thousands of life-saving visas signed by Sousa Mendes in June 1940 (visa #1902 for Lazare Censor and family, dated 17 June\n1940).\nCourtesy of the Sousa Mendes Foundation.\nConsequently, in 1958 the Chinese government was told that annual grain production was 50 per\ncent more than it actually was. Believing the reports, the government sold millions of tons of rice to\nforeign countries in exchange for weapons and heavy machinery, assuming that enough was left to\nfeed the Chinese population. The result was the worst famine in history and the death of tens of\nmillions of Chinese.\n3\nMeanwhile, enthusiastic reports of China\u2019s farming miracle reached audiences throughout the\nworld. Julius Nyerere, the idealistic president of Tanzania, was deeply impressed by the Chinese\nsuccess. In order to modernise Tanzanian agriculture, Nyerere resolved to establish collective farms\non the Chinese model. When peasants objected to the command, Nyerere sent the army and police to\ndestroy traditional villages and forcefully move hundreds of thousands of peasants onto the new\ncollective farms.\nGovernment propaganda depicted the farms as miniature paradises, but many of them existed only\nin government documents. The protocols and reports written in the capital Dar es Salaam said that on\nsuch-and-such a date the inhabitants of such-and-such village were relocated to such-and-such farm.\nIn reality, when the villagers reached their destination, they found absolutely nothing there. No\nhouses, no fields, no tools. The officials reported great successes to themselves and to President\nNyerere. In fact, within less than ten years Tanzania was transformed from Africa\u2019s biggest food\nexporter into a net food importer that could not feed itself without external assistance. In 1979, 90 per\ncent of Tanzanian farmers lived in collective farms, but they generated only 5 per cent of the country\u2019s\nagricultural output.\n4\nThough the history of writing is full of similar mishaps, in most cases writing did enable officials\nto organise the state much more efficiently than before. Indeed, even the disaster of the Great Leap\nForward didn\u2019t topple the Chinese Communist Party from power. The catastrophe was caused by the\nability to impose written fantasies on reality, but exactly the same ability allowed the party to paint a\nrosy picture of its successes and hold on to power tenaciously.\nWritten language may have been conceived as a modest way of describing reality, but it gradually\nbecame a powerful way to reshape reality. When official reports collided with objective reality, it\nwas often reality that had to give way. Anyone who has ever dealt with the tax authorities, the\neducational system or any other complex bureaucracy knows that the truth hardly matters. What\u2019s\nwritten on your form is far more important.\nHoly Scriptures\nIs it true that when text and reality collide, reality sometimes has to give way? Isn\u2019t it just a common\nbut exaggerated slander of bureaucratic systems? Most bureaucrats \u2013 whether serving pharaoh or Mao\nZedong \u2013 were reasonable people, and surely would have made the following argument: \u2018We use\nwriting to describe the reality of fields, canals and granaries. If the description is accurate, we make\nrealistic decisions. If the description is inaccurate, it causes famines and even rebellions. Then we, or\nthe administrators of some future regime, learn from the mistake, and strive to produce more truthful\ndescriptions. So over time, our documents are bound to become ever more precise.\u2019\nThat\u2019s true to some extent, but it ignores an opposite historical dynamic. As bureaucracies\naccumulate power, they become immune to their own mistakes. Instead of changing their stories to fit\nreality, they can change reality to fit their stories. In the end, external reality matches their\nbureaucratic fantasies, but only because they forced reality to do so. For example, the borders of\nmany African countries disregard river lines, mountain ranges and trade routes, split historical and\neconomic zones unnecessarily, and ignore local ethnic and religious identities. The same tribe may\nfind itself riven between several countries, whereas one country may incorporate splinters of\nnumerous rival clans. Such problems bedevil countries all over the world, but in Africa they are\nparticularly acute because modern African borders don\u2019t reflect the wishes and struggles of local\nnations. They were drawn by European bureaucrats who never set foot in Africa.\nIn the late nineteenth century, several European powers laid claim to African territories. Fearing\nthat conflicting claims might lead to an all-out European war, the concerned parties got together in\nBerlin in 1884, and divided Africa as if it were a pie. Back then, much of the African interior was\nterra incognita to Europeans. The British, French and Germans had accurate maps of Africa\u2019s coastal\nregions, and knew precisely where the Niger, the Congo and the Zambezi empty into the ocean.\nHowever, they knew little about the course these rivers took inland, about the kingdoms and tribes\nthat lived along their banks, and about local religion, history and geography. This hardly mattered to\nthe European diplomats. They took out an empty map of Africa, spread it over a well-polished Berlin\ntable, sketched lines here and there, and divided the continent between them.\nWhen the Europeans penetrated the African interior, armed with the agreed-upon map, they\ndiscovered that many of the borders drawn in Berlin hardly did justice to the geographic, economic\nand ethnic reality of Africa. However, to avoid renewed clashes, the invaders stuck to their\nagreements, and these imaginary lines became the actual borders of European colonies. During the\nsecond half of the twentieth century, as the European empires disintegrated and the colonies gained\ntheir independence, the new countries accepted the colonial borders, fearing that the alternative\nwould be endless wars and conflicts. Many of the difficulties faced by present-day African countries\nstem from the fact that their borders make little sense. When the written fantasies of European\nbureaucracies encountered the African reality, reality was forced to surrender.\n5\nThe modern educational system provides numerous other examples of reality bowing down to\nwritten records. When measuring the width of my desk, the yardstick I am using matters little. My\ndesk remains the same width regardless of whether I say it is 200 centimetres or 78.74 inches.\nHowever, when bureaucracies measure people, the yardsticks they choose make all the difference.\nWhen schools began assessing people according to precise marks, the lives of millions of students\nand teachers changed dramatically. Marks are a relatively new invention. Hunter-gatherers were\nnever marked for their achievements, and even thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution,\nfew educational establishments used precise marks. A medieval apprentice cobbler did not receive at\nthe end of the year a piece of paper saying he has got an A on shoelaces but a C minus on buckles. An\nundergraduate in Shakespeare\u2019s day left Oxford with one of only two possible results \u2013 with a degree,\nor without one. Nobody thought of giving one student a final mark of 74 and another student 88.\n6\nA European map of Africa from the mid-nineteenth century. The Europeans knew very little about the African interior, which did not\nprevent them from dividing the continent and drawing its borders.\n\u00a9 Antiqua Print Gallery/Alamy Stock Photo.\nOnly the mass educational systems of the industrial age began using precise marks on a regular\nbasis. Since both factories and government ministries became accustomed to thinking in the language\nof numbers, schools followed suit. They started to gauge the worth of each student according to his or\nher average mark, whereas the worth of each teacher and principal was judged according to the\nschool\u2019s overall average. Once bureaucrats adopted this yardstick, reality was transformed.\nOriginally, schools were supposed to focus on enlightening and educating students, and marks were\nmerely a means of measuring success. But naturally enough, schools soon began focusing on getting\nhigh marks. As every child, teacher and inspector knows, the skills required to get high marks in an\nexam are not the same as a true understanding of literature, biology or mathematics. Every child,\nteacher and inspector also knows that when forced to choose between the two, most schools will go\nfor the marks.\nThe power of written records reached its apogee with the appearance of holy scriptures. Priests\nand scribes in ancient civilisations got used to seeing documents as guidebooks for reality. At first,\nthe texts told them about the reality of taxes, fields and granaries. But as the bureaucracy gained\npower, so the texts gained authority. Priests wrote down not just the god\u2019s property list, but also the\ngod\u2019s deeds, commandments and secrets. The resulting scriptures purported to describe reality in its\nentirety, and generations of scholars became accustomed to looking for all the answers in the pages of\nthe Bible, the Qur\u2019an or the Vedas.\nIn theory, if some holy book misrepresented reality, its disciples would sooner or later find it out,\nand the text would lose its authority. Abraham Lincoln said you cannot deceive everybody all the\ntime. Well, that\u2019s wishful thinking. In practice, the power of human cooperation networks rests on a\ndelicate balance between truth and fiction. If you distort reality too much, it will weaken you, and you\nwill not be able to compete against more clear-sighted rivals. On the other hand, you cannot organise\nmasses of people effectively without relying on some fictional myths. So if you stick to pure reality,\nwithout mixing any fiction with it, few people would follow you.\nIf you used a time machine to send a modern scientist to ancient Egypt, she would not be able to\nseize power by exposing the fictions of the local priests and lecturing the peasants on evolution,\nrelativity and quantum physics. Of course, if our scientist could use her knowledge in order to\nproduce a few rifles and artillery pieces, she could gain a huge advantage over pharaoh and the\ncrocodile god Sobek. Yet in order to mine iron, build furnaces and manufacture gunpowder the\nscientist would need a lot of hard-working peasants. Do you really think she could inspire them by\nexplaining that energy divided by mass equals the speed of light squared? If you happen to think so,\nyou are welcome to travel to Afghanistan or Syria and try your luck.\nReally powerful human organisations \u2013 such as pharaonic Egypt, communist China, the European\nempires and the modern school system \u2013 are not necessarily clear-sighted. Much of their power rests\non their ability to force their fictional beliefs on a submissive reality. That\u2019s the whole idea of money,\nfor example. The government takes worthless pieces of paper, declares them to be valuable and then\nuses them to compute the value of everything else. The government has enough power to force citizens\nto pay taxes using these pieces of paper, so the citizens have no choice but to get their hand on at least\nsome bills. The bills consequently become really valuable, the government officials are vindicated in\ntheir beliefs, and since the government controls the issuing of paper money, its power grows. If\nsomebody protests that \u2018These are just worthless pieces of paper!\u2019 and behaves as if they are only\npieces of paper, he won\u2019t get very far in life.\nThe same thing happens when the educational system declares that matriculation exams are the best\nmethod to evaluate students. The system has enough authority to influence acceptance conditions to\ncolleges, government offices and private-sector jobs. Students therefore invest all their efforts in\ngetting good marks. Coveted positions are manned by people with high marks, who naturally support\nthe system that brought them there. The fact that the educational system controls the critical exams\ngives it more power, and increases its influence over colleges, government offices and the job market.\nIf somebody protests that \u2018The degree certificate is just a piece of paper!\u2019 and behaves accordingly,\nhe is unlikely to get very far in life.\nHoly scriptures work the same way. The religious establishment proclaims that the holy book\ncontains the answers to all our questions. It simultaneously forces courts, governments and businesses\nto behave according to what the holy book says. When a wise person reads scriptures and then looks\nat the world, he sees that there is indeed a good match. \u2018Scriptures say that you must pay tithes to God\n\u2013 and look, everybody pays. Scriptures say that women are inferior to men, and cannot serve as\njudges or even give testimony in court \u2013 and look, there are indeed no women judges and the courts\nreject their testimony. Scriptures say that whoever studies the word of God will succeed in life \u2013 and\nlook, all the good jobs are indeed held by people who know the holy book by heart.\u2019\nSuch a wise person will naturally begin to study the holy book, and because he is wise, he will\nbecome a scriptural pundit. He will consequently be appointed a judge. When he becomes a judge, he\nwill not allow women to bear witness in court, and when he chooses his successor, he will obviously\npick somebody who knows the holy book well. If someone protests that \u2018This book is just paper!\u2019 and\nbehaves accordingly, such a heretic will not get very far in life.\nEven when scriptures mislead people about the true nature of reality, they can nevertheless retain\ntheir authority for thousands of years. For instance, the biblical perception of history is fundamentally\nflawed, yet it managed to spread throughout the world, and billions still believe in it. The Bible\npeddled a monotheistic theory of history, which says that the world is governed by a single allpowerful deity, who cares above all else about me and my doings. If something good happens, it must\nbe a reward for my good deeds. Any catastrophe must surely be punishment for my sins.\nThus the ancient Jews believed that if they suffered from drought, or if King Nebuchadnezzar of\nBabylonia invaded Judaea and exiled its people, surely these were divine punishments for their own\nsins. And if King Cyrus of Persia defeated the Babylonians and allowed the Jewish exiles to return\nhome and rebuild Jerusalem, God in his mercy must have heard their remorseful prayers. The Bible\ndoesn\u2019t recognise the possibility that perhaps the drought resulted from a volcanic eruption in the\nPhilippines, that Nebuchadnezzar invaded in pursuit of Babylonian commercial interests and that King\nCyrus had his own political reasons to favour the Jews. The Bible accordingly shows no interest\nwhatsoever in understanding the global ecology, the Babylonian economy or the Persian political\nsystem.\nSuch self-absorption characterises all humans in their childhood. Children of all religions and\ncultures think they are the centre of the world, and therefore show little genuine interest in the\nconditions and feelings of other people. That\u2019s why divorce is so traumatic for children. A five-yearold cannot understand that something important is happening for reasons unrelated to him. No matter\nhow many times you tell him that mummy and daddy are independent people with their own problems\nand wishes, and that they didn\u2019t divorce because of him \u2013 the child cannot absorb that. He is\nconvinced that everything happens because of him. Most people grow out of this infantile delusion.\nMonotheists hold on to it till the day they die. Like a child thinking that his parents are fighting\nbecause of him, the monotheist is convinced that the Persians are fighting the Babylonians because of\nhim.\nAlready in biblical times some cultures had a far more accurate perception of history. Animist and\npolytheist religions depicted the world as the playground of numerous different powers rather than a\nsingle god. It was consequently easy for animists and polytheists to accept that many events are\nunrelated to me or to my favourite deity, and they are neither punishments for my sins nor rewards for\nmy good deeds. Greek historians such as Herodotus and Thucydides, and Chinese historians such as\nSima Qian, developed sophisticated theories of history which are very similar to our own modern\nviews. They explained that wars and revolutions break out due to a plethora of political, social and\neconomic factors. People may fall victim to a war for no fault of their own. Accordingly, Herodotus\nshowed keen interest in understanding Persian politics, while Sima Qian was very concerned about\nthe culture and religion of barbarous steppe people.\n7\nPresent-day scholars agree with Herodotus and Sima Qian rather than with the Bible. That\u2019s why\nall modern states invest so much effort in collecting information about other countries, and in\nanalysing global ecological, political and economic trends. When the US economy falters, even\nevangelical Republicans sometimes point an accusing finger at China rather than at their own sins.\nYet even though Herodotus and Thucydides understood reality much better than the authors of the\nBible, when the two world views collided, the Bible won by a knockout. The Greeks adopted the\nJewish view of history, rather than vice versa. A thousand years after Thucydides, the Greeks became\nconvinced that if some barbarian horde invaded, surely it was divine punishment for their sins. No\nmatter how mistaken the biblical world view was, it provided a better basis for large-scale human\ncooperation.\nBut it Works!\nFictions enable us to cooperate better. The price we pay is that the same fictions also determine the\ngoals of our cooperation. So we may have very elaborate systems of cooperation, which are\nharnessed to serve fictional aims and interests. Consequently the system may seem to be working\nwell, but only if we adopt the system\u2019s own criteria. For example, a Muslim mullah would say: \u2018Our\nsystem works. There are now 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide, and more people study the Qur\u2019an and\nsubmit themselves to Allah\u2019s will than ever before.\u2019 The key question, though, is whether this is the\nright yardstick for measuring success. A school principal would say: \u2018Our system works. During the\nlast five years, exam results have risen by 7.3 per cent.\u2019 Yet is that the best way to judge a school? An\nofficial in ancient Egypt would say: \u2018Our system works. We collect more taxes, dig more canals and\nbuild bigger pyramids than anyone else in the world.\u2019 True enough, pharaonic Egypt led the world in\ntaxation, irrigation and pyramid construction. But is that what really counts?\nPeople have many material, social and mental needs. It is far from clear that peasants in ancient\nEgypt enjoyed more love or better social relations than their hunter-gatherer ancestors, and in terms\nof nutrition, health and child mortality it seems that life was actually worse. A document dated c.1850\nBC from the reign of Amenemhat III \u2013 the pharaoh who created Lake Fayum \u2013 tells of a well-to-do\nman called Dua-Khety who took his son Pepy to school, so that he could learn to be a scribe. On the\nway to school, Dua-Khety portrayed the miserable life of peasants, labourers, soldiers and artisans,\nso as to encourage Pepy to devote all his energy to studying, thereby escaping the destiny of most\nhumans.\nAccording to Dua-Khety, the life of a landless field labourer is full of hardship and misery.\nDressed in mere tatters, he works all day till his fingers are covered in blisters. Then pharaoh\u2019s\nofficials come and take him away to do forced labour. In return for all his hard work he receives only\nsickness as payment. Even if he makes it home alive, he will be completely worn out and ruined. The\nfate of the landholding peasant is hardly better. He spends his days carrying water in buckets from the\nriver to the field. The heavy load bends his shoulders and covers his neck with festering swellings. In\nthe morning he has to water his plot of leeks, in the afternoon his date palms and in the evening his\ncoriander field. Eventually he drops down and dies.\n8 The text might exaggerate things on purpose, but\nnot by much. Pharaonic Egypt was the most powerful kingdom of its day, but for the simple peasant\nall that power meant taxes and forced labour rather than clinics and social security services.\nThis was not a uniquely Egyptian defect. Despite all the immense achievements of the Chinese\ndynasties, the Muslim empires and the European kingdoms, even in AD 1850 the life of the average\nperson was not better \u2013 and might actually have been worse \u2013 than the lives of archaic huntergatherers. In 1850 a Chinese peasant or a Manchester factory hand worked longer hours than their\nhunter-gatherer ancestors; their jobs were physically harder and mentally less fulfilling; their diet was\nless balanced; hygiene conditions were incomparably worse; and infectious diseases were far more\ncommon.\nSuppose you were given a choice between the following two vacation packages:\nStone Age package: On day one we will hike for ten hours in a pristine forest, setting camp for the\nnight in a clearing by a river. On day two we will canoe down the river for ten hours, camping on the\nshores of a small lake. On day three we will learn from the native people how to fish in the lake and\nhow to find mushrooms in the nearby woods.\nModern proletarian package: On day one we will work for ten hours in a polluted textile factory,\npassing the night in a cramped apartment block. On day two we will work for ten hours as cashiers in\nthe local department store, going back to sleep in the same apartment block. On day three we will\nlearn from the native people how to open a bank account and fill out mortgage forms.\nWhich package would you choose?\nHence when we come to evaluate human cooperation networks, it all depends on the yardsticks and\nviewpoint we adopt. Are we judging pharaonic Egypt in terms of production, nutrition or perhaps\nsocial harmony? Do we focus on the aristocracy, the simple peasants, or the pigs and crocodiles?\nHistory isn\u2019t a single narrative, but thousands of alternative narratives. Whenever we choose to tell\none, we are also choosing to silence others.\nHuman cooperative networks usually judge themselves by yardsticks of their own invention, and\nnot surprisingly, they often give themselves high marks. In particular, human networks built in the\nname of imaginary entities such as gods, nations and corporations normally judge their success from\nthe viewpoint of the imaginary entity. A religion is successful if it follows divine commandments to\nthe letter; a nation is glorious if it promotes the national interest; and a corporation thrives if it makes\na lot of money.\nWhen examining the history of any human network, it is therefore advisable to stop from time to\ntime and look at things from the perspective of some real entity. How do you know if an entity is real?\nVery simple \u2013 just ask yourself, \u2018Can it suffer?\u2019 When people burn down the temple of Zeus, Zeus\ndoesn\u2019t suffer. When the euro loses its value, the euro doesn\u2019t suffer. When a bank goes bankrupt, the\nbank doesn\u2019t suffer. When a country suffers a defeat in war, the country doesn\u2019t really suffer. It\u2019s just a\nmetaphor. In contrast, when a soldier is wounded in battle, he really does suffer. When a famished\npeasant has nothing to eat, she suffers. When a cow is separated from her newborn calf, she suffers.\nThis is reality.\nOf course suffering might well be caused by our belief in fictions. For example, belief in national\nand religious myths might cause the outbreak of war, in which millions lose their homes, their limbs\nand even their lives. The cause of war is fictional, but the suffering is 100 per cent real. This is\nexactly why we should strive to distinguish fiction from reality.\nFiction isn\u2019t bad. It is vital. Without commonly accepted stories about things like money, states or\ncorporations, no complex human society can function. We can\u2019t play football unless everyone\nbelieves in the same made-up rules, and we can\u2019t enjoy the benefits of markets and courts without\nsimilar make-believe stories. But the stories are just tools. They should not become our goals or our\nyardsticks. When we forget that they are mere fiction, we lose touch with reality. Then we begin\nentire wars \u2018to make a lot of money for the corporation\u2019 or \u2018to protect the national interest\u2019.\nCorporations, money and nations exist only in our imagination. We invented them to serve us; how\ncome we find ourselves sacrificing our lives in their service?\n5\nThe Odd Couple\nStories serve as the foundations and pillars of human societies. As history unfolded, stories about\ngods, nations and corporations grew so powerful that they began to dominate objective reality.\nBelieving in the great god Sobek, the Mandate of Heaven or the Bible enabled people to build Lake\nFayum, the Great Wall of China and Chartres Cathedral. Unfortunately, blind faith in these stories\nmeant that human efforts frequently focused on increasing the glory of fictional entities such as gods\nand nations, instead of bettering the lives of real sentient beings.\nDoes this analysis still hold true today? At first sight, it seems that modern society is very different\nfrom the kingdoms of ancient Egypt or medieval China. Hasn\u2019t the rise of modern science changed the\nbasic rules of the human game? Wouldn\u2019t it be true to say that despite the ongoing importance of\ntraditional myths, modern social systems rely increasingly on objective scientific theories such as the\ntheory of evolution, which simply did not exist in ancient Egypt or medieval China?\nWe could of course argue that scientific theories are a new kind of myth, and that our belief in\nscience is no different from the ancient Egyptians\u2019 belief in the great god Sobek. Yet the comparison\ndoesn\u2019t hold water. Sobek existed only in the collective imagination of his devotees. Praying to Sobek\nhelped cement the Egyptian social system, thereby enabling people to build dams and canals that\nprevented floods and droughts. Yet the prayers themselves didn\u2019t raise or lower the Nile\u2019s water\nlevel by a millimetre. In contrast, scientific theories are not just a way to bind people together. It is\noften said that God helps those who help themselves. This is a roundabout way of saying that God\ndoesn\u2019t exist, but if our belief in Him inspires us to do something ourselves \u2013 it helps. Antibiotics,\nunlike God, help even those who don\u2019t help themselves. They cure infections whether you believe in\nthem or not.\nConsequently, the modern world is very different from the premodern world. Egyptian pharaohs\nand Chinese emperors failed to overcome famine, plague and war despite millennia of effort. Modern\nsocieties managed to do it within a few centuries. Isn\u2019t it the fruit of abandoning intersubjective myths\nin favour of objective scientific knowledge? And can\u2019t we expect this process to accelerate in the\ncoming decades? As technology allows us to upgrade humans, overcome old age and find the key to\nhappiness, so people would care less about fictional gods, nations and corporations, and focus\ninstead on deciphering the physical and biological reality.\nIn truth, however, things are far more complicated. Modern science certainly changed the rules of\nthe game, but it did not simply replace myths with facts. Myths continue to dominate humankind.\nScience only makes these myths stronger. Instead of destroying the intersubjective reality, science\nwill enable it to control the objective and subjective realities more completely than ever before.\nThanks to computers and bioengineering, the difference between fiction and reality will blur, as\npeople reshape reality to match their pet fictions.\nThe priests of Sobek imagined the existence of divine crocodiles, while pharaoh dreamt about\nimmortality. In reality, the sacred crocodile was a very ordinary swamp reptile dressed in golden\nfineries, and pharaoh was as mortal as the simplest of peasants. After death, his corpse was\nmummified using preservative balms and scented perfumes, but it was as lifeless as one can get. In\ncontrast, twenty-first-century scientists might be able to really engineer super-crocodiles, and to\nprovide the human elite with eternal youth here on earth.\nConsequently the rise of science will make at least some myths and religions mightier than ever. To\nunderstand why, and to face the challenges of the twenty-first century, we should therefore revisit one\nof the most nagging questions of all: how does modern science relate to religion? It seems that people\nhave already said a million times everything there is to say about this question. Yet in practice,\nscience and religion are like a husband and wife who after 500 years of marriage counselling still\ndon\u2019t know each other. He still dreams about Cinderella and she keeps pining for Prince Charming,\nwhile they argue about whose turn it is to take out the rubbish.\nGerms and Demons\nMost of the misunderstandings regarding science and religion result from faulty definitions of\nreligion. All too often, people confuse religion with superstition, spirituality, belief in supernatural\npowers or belief in gods. Religion is none of these things. Religion cannot be equated with\nsuperstition, because most people are unlikely to call their cherished beliefs \u2018superstitions\u2019. We\nalways believe in \u2018the truth\u2019. It\u2019s only other people who believe in superstitions.\nSimilarly, few people put their faith in supernatural powers. For those who believe in demons,\ndemons aren\u2019t supernatural. They are an integral part of nature, just like porcupines, scorpions and\ngerms. Modern physicians blame disease on invisible germs, and voodoo priests blame disease on\ninvisible demons. There\u2019s nothing supernatural about it: you make some demon angry, so the demon\nenters your body and causes you pain. What could be more natural than that? Only those who don\u2019t\nbelieve in demons think of them as standing apart from the natural order of things.\nEquating religion with faith in supernatural powers implies that you can understand all known\nnatural phenomena without religion, which is just an optional supplement. Having understood\nperfectly well the whole of nature, you can now choose whether to add some \u2018super-natural\u2019 religious\ndogma or not. However, most religions argue that you simply cannot understand the world without\nthem. You will never comprehend the true reason for disease, drought or earthquakes if you do not\ntake their dogma into account.\nDefining religion as \u2018belief in gods\u2019 is also problematic. We tend to say that a devout Christian is\nreligious because she believes in God, whereas a fervent communist isn\u2019t religious, because\ncommunism has no gods. However, religion is created by humans rather than by gods, and it is\ndefined by its social function rather than by the existence of deities. Religion is anything that confers\nsuperhuman legitimacy on human social structures. It legitimises human norms and values by arguing\nthat they reflect superhuman laws.\nReligion asserts that we humans are subject to a system of moral laws that we did not invent and\nthat we cannot change. A devout Jew would say that this is the system of moral laws created by God\nand revealed in the Bible. A Hindu would say that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva created the laws, which\nwere revealed to us humans in the Vedas. Other religions, from Buddhism and Daoism to Nazism,\ncommunism and liberalism, argue that the superhuman laws are natural laws, and not the creation of\nthis or that god. Of course, each believes in a different set of natural laws discovered and revealed by\ndifferent seers and prophets, from Buddha and Laozi to Hitler and Lenin.\nA Jewish boy comes to his father and asks, \u2018Dad, why shouldn\u2019t we eat pork?\u2019 The father strokes\nhis long white beard thoughtfully and answers, \u2018Well, Yankele, that\u2019s how the world works. You are\nstill young and you don\u2019t understand, but if we eat pork, God will punish us and we will come to a\nbad end. It isn\u2019t my idea. It\u2019s not even the rabbi\u2019s idea. If the rabbi had created the world, maybe he\nwould have created a world in which pork was perfectly kosher. But the rabbi didn\u2019t create the world\n\u2013 God did it. And God said, I don\u2019t know why, that we shouldn\u2019t eat pork. So we shouldn\u2019t.\nCapeesh?\u2019\nIn 1943 a German boy comes to his father, a senior SS officer, and asks, \u2018Dad, why are we killing\nthe Jews?\u2019 The father puts on his shiny leather boots, and meanwhile explains, \u2018Well, Fritz, that\u2019s how\nthe world works. You are still young and you don\u2019t understand, but if we allow the Jews to live, they\nwill cause the degeneration and extinction of humankind. It\u2019s not my idea, and it\u2019s not even the\nF\u00fchrer\u2019s idea. If Hitler had created the world, maybe he would have created a world in which the\nlaws of natural selection did not apply, and Jews and Aryans could all live together in perfect\nharmony. But Hitler didn\u2019t create the world. He just managed to decipher the laws of nature, and then\ninstructed us how to live in line with them. If we disobey these laws, we will come to a bad end. Is\nthat clear?!\u2019\nIn 2016 a British boy comes to his father, a liberal MP, and asks, \u2018Dad, why should we care about\nthe human rights of Muslims in the Middle East?\u2019 The father puts down his cup of tea, thinks for a\nmoment, and says, \u2018Well, Duncan, that\u2019s how the world works. You are still young and you don\u2019t\nunderstand, but all humans, even Muslims in the Middle East, have the same nature and therefore\nenjoy the same natural rights. This isn\u2019t my idea, nor a decision of Parliament. If Parliament had\ncreated the world, universal human rights might well have been buried in some subcommittee along\nwith all that quantum physics stuff. But Parliament didn\u2019t create the world, it just tries to make sense\nof it, and we must respect the natural rights even of Muslims in the Middle East, or very soon our own\nrights will also be violated, and we will come to a bad end. Now off you go.\u2019\nLiberals, communists and followers of other modern creeds dislike describing their own system as\na \u2018religion\u2019, because they identify religion with superstitions and supernatural powers. If you tell\ncommunists or liberals that they are religious, they think you accuse them of blindly believing in\ngroundless pipe dreams. In fact, it means only that they believe in some system of moral laws that\nwasn\u2019t invented by humans, but which humans must nevertheless obey. As far as we know, all human\nsocieties believe in this. Every society tells its members that they must obey some superhuman moral\nlaw, and that breaking this law will result in catastrophe.\nReligions differ of course in the details of their stories, their concrete commandments, and the\nrewards and punishments they promise. Thus in medieval Europe the Catholic Church argued that\nGod doesn\u2019t like rich people. Jesus said that it is harder for a rich man to pass through the gates of\nheaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, and the Church encouraged the rich to\ngive lots of alms, threatening that misers will burn in hell. Modern communism also dislikes rich\npeople, but it threatens them with class conflict here and now, rather than with burning sulphur after\ndeath.\nThe communist laws of history are similar to the commandments of the Christian God, inasmuch as\nthey are superhuman forces that humans cannot change at will. People can decide tomorrow morning\nto cancel the offside rule in football, because we invented that law, and we are free to change it.\nHowever, at least according to Marx, we cannot change the laws of history. No matter what the\ncapitalists do, as long as they continue to accumulate private property they are bound to create class\nconflict and they are destined to be defeated by the rising proletariat.\nIf you happen to be a communist yourself you might argue that communism and Christianity are\nnevertheless very different, because communism is right, whereas Christianity is wrong. Class\nconflict really is inherent in the capitalist system, whereas rich people don\u2019t suffer eternal tortures in\nhell after they die. Yet even if that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t mean communism is not a religion. Rather, it\nmeans that communism is the one true religion. Followers of every religion are convinced that theirs\nalone is true. Perhaps the followers of one religion are right.\nIf You Meet the Buddha\nThe assertion that religion is a tool for preserving social order and for organising large-scale\ncooperation may vex many people for whom it represents first and foremost a spiritual path.\nHowever, just as the gap between religion and science is smaller than we commonly think, so the gap\nbetween religion and spirituality is much bigger. Religion is a deal, whereas spirituality is a journey.\nReligion gives a complete description of the world, and offers us a well-defined contract with\npredetermined goals. \u2018God exists. He told us to behave in certain ways. If you obey God, you\u2019ll be\nadmitted to heaven. If you disobey Him, you\u2019ll burn in hell.\u2019 The very clarity of this deal allows\nsociety to define common norms and values that regulate human behaviour.\nSpiritual journeys are nothing like that. They usually take people in mysterious ways towards\nunknown destinations. The quest usually begins with some big question, such as who am I? What is\nthe meaning of life? What is good? Whereas many people just accept the ready-made answers\nprovided by the powers that be, spiritual seekers are not so easily satisfied. They are determined to\nfollow the big question wherever it leads, and not just to places you know well or wish to visit. Thus\nfor most people, academic studies are a deal rather than a spiritual journey, because they take us to a\npredetermined goal approved by our elders, governments and banks. \u2018I\u2019ll study for three years, pass\nthe exams, get my BA certificate and secure a well-paid job.\u2019 Academic studies might be transformed\ninto a spiritual journey if the big questions you encounter on the way deflect you towards unexpected\ndestinations, of which you could hardly even conceive at first. For example, a student might begin to\nstudy economics in order to secure a job in Wall Street. However, if what she learns somehow causes\nher to end up in a Hindu ashram or helping HIV patients in Zimbabwe, then we might call that a\nspiritual journey.\nWhy label such a voyage \u2018spiritual\u2019? This is a legacy from ancient dualist religions that believed in\nthe existence of two gods, one good and one evil. According to dualism, the good god created pure\nand everlasting souls that lived in a wonderful world of spirit. However, the bad god \u2013 sometimes\nnamed Satan \u2013 created another world, made of matter. Satan didn\u2019t know how to make his creation\nlast, hence in the world of matter everything rots and disintegrates. In order to breathe life into his\ndefective creation, Satan tempted souls from the pure world of spirit, and locked them up inside\nmaterial bodies. That\u2019s what humans are \u2013 a good spiritual soul trapped inside an evil material body.\nSince the soul\u2019s prison \u2013 the body \u2013 decays and eventually dies, Satan ceaselessly tempts the soul\nwith bodily delights, and above all with food, sex and power. When the body disintegrates and the\nsoul has a chance to escape back to the spiritual world, its craving for bodily pleasures draws it back\ninside some new material body. The soul thus transmigrates from body to body, wasting its days in\npursuit of food, sex and power.\nDualism instructs people to break these material shackles and undertake a journey back to the\nspiritual world, which is totally unfamiliar to us, but is our true home. During this quest we must\nreject all material temptations and deals. Due to this dualist legacy, every journey on which we doubt\nthe conventions and deals of the mundane world and walk towards an unknown destination is called\n\u2018a spiritual journey\u2019.\nSuch journeys are fundamentally different from religions, because religions seek to cement the\nworldly order whereas spirituality seeks to escape it. Often enough, the most important demand from\nspiritual wanderers is to challenge the beliefs and conventions of dominant religions. In Zen\nBuddhism it is said that \u2018If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.\u2019 Which means that if while\nwalking on the spiritual path you encounter the rigid ideas and fixed laws of institutionalised\nBuddhism, you must free yourself from them too.\nFor religions, spirituality is a dangerous threat. Religions typically strive to rein in the spiritual\nquests of their followers, and many religious systems were challenged not by laypeople preoccupied\nwith food, sex and power, but rather by spiritual truth-seekers who wanted more than platitudes. Thus\nthe Protestant revolt against the authority of the Catholic Church was ignited not by hedonistic atheists\nbut rather by a devout and ascetic monk, Martin Luther. Luther wanted answers to the existential\nquestions of life, and refused to settle for the rites, rituals and deals offered by the Church.\nIn Luther\u2019s day, the Church promised its followers very enticing deals. If you sinned, and feared\neternal damnation in the afterlife, all you needed to do was buy an indulgence. In the early sixteenth\ncentury the Church employed professional \u2018salvation peddlers\u2019 who wandered the towns and villages\nof Europe and sold indulgences for fixed prices. You want an entry visa to heaven? Pay ten gold\ncoins. You want Grandpa Heinz and Grandma Gertrud to join you there? No problem, but it will cost\nyou thirty coins. The most famous of these peddlers, the Dominican friar Johannes Tetzel, allegedly\nsaid that the moment the coin clinks in the money chest, the soul flies out of purgatory to heaven.\n1\nThe more Luther thought about it, the more he doubted this deal, and the Church that offered it. You\ncannot just buy your way to salvation. The Pope couldn\u2019t possibly have the authority to forgive\npeople their sins, and open the gates of heaven. According to Protestant tradition, on 31 October 1517\nLuther walked to the All Saints\u2019 Church in Wittenberg, carrying a lengthy document, a hammer and\nsome nails. The document listed ninety-five theses against contemporary religious practices,\nincluding against the selling of indulgences. Luther nailed it to the church door, sparking the Protestant\nReformation, which called upon any human who cared about salvation to rebel against the Pope\u2019s\nauthority and search for alternative routes to heaven.\nThe Pope selling indulgences for money (from a Protestant pamphlet).\nWoodcut from \u2018Passional Christi und Antichristi\u2019 by Philipp Melanchthon, published in 1521, Cranach, Lucas (1472\u20131553) (studio of) \u00a9\nPrivate Collection/Bridgeman Images.\nFrom a historical perspective, the spiritual journey is always tragic, for it is a lonely path fit for\nindividuals rather than for entire societies. Human cooperation requires firm answers rather than just\nquestions, and those who foam against stultified religious structures end up forging new structures in\ntheir place. It happened to the dualists, whose spiritual journeys became religious establishments. It\nhappened to Martin Luther, who after challenging the laws, institutions and rituals of the Catholic\nChurch found himself writing new law books, founding new institutions and inventing new\nceremonies. It happened even to Buddha and Jesus. In their uncompromising quest for the truth they\nsubverted the laws, rituals and structures of traditional Hinduism and Judaism. But eventually more\nlaws, more rituals and more structures were created in their name than in the name of any other\nperson in history.\nCounterfeiting God\nNow that we have a better understanding of religion, we can go back to examining the relationship\nbetween religion and science. There are two extreme interpretations for this relationship. One view\nsays that science and religion are sworn enemies, and that modern history was shaped by the life-anddeath struggle of scientific knowledge against religious superstition. With time, the light of science\ndispelled the darkness of religion, and the world became increasingly secular, rational and\nprosperous. However, though some scientific findings certainly undermine religious dogmas, this is\nnot inevitable. For example, Muslim dogma holds that Islam was founded by the prophet Muhammad\nin seventh-century Arabia, and there is ample scientific evidence supporting this.\nMore importantly, science always needs religious assistance in order to create viable human\ninstitutions. Scientists study how the world functions, but there is no scientific method for determining\nhow humans ought to behave. Science tells us that humans cannot survive without oxygen. However,\nis it okay to execute criminals by asphyxiation? Science doesn\u2019t know how to answer such a question.\nOnly religions provide us with the necessary guidance.\nHence every practical project scientists undertake also relies on religious insights. Take, for\nexample, the building of the Three Gorges Dam over the Yangtze River. When the Chinese\ngovernment decided to build the dam in 1992, physicists could calculate what pressures the dam\nwould have to withstand, economists could forecast how much money it would probably cost, while\nelectrical engineers could predict how much electricity it would produce. However, the government\nneeded to take additional factors into account. Building the dam flooded huge territories containing\nmany villages and towns, thousands of archaeological sites, and unique landscapes and habitats.\nMore than 1 million people were displaced and hundreds of species were endangered. It seems that\nthe dam directly caused the extinction of the Chinese river dolphin. No matter what you personally\nthink about the Three Gorges Dam, it is clear that building it was an ethical rather than a purely\nscientific issue. No physics experiment, no economic model and no mathematical equation can\ndetermine whether generating thousands of megawatts and making billions of yuan is more valuable\nthan saving an ancient pagoda or the Chinese river dolphin. Consequently, China cannot function on\nthe basis of scientific theories alone. It requires some religion or ideology, too.\nSome jump to the opposite extreme, and say that science and religion are completely separate\nkingdoms. Science studies facts, religion speaks about values, and never the twain shall meet.\nReligion has nothing to say about scientific facts, and science should keep its mouth shut concerning\nreligious convictions. If the Pope believes that human life is sacred, and abortion is therefore a sin,\nbiologists can neither prove nor refute this claim. As a private individual, each biologist is welcome\nto argue with the Pope. But as a scientist, the biologist cannot enter the fray.\nThis approach may sound sensible, but it misunderstands religion. Though science indeed deals\nonly with facts, religion never confines itself to ethical judgements. Religion cannot provide us with\nany practical guidance unless it makes some factual claims too, and here it may well collide with\nscience. The most important segments of many religious dogmas are not their ethical principles, but\nrather factual statements such as \u2018God exists\u2019, \u2018the soul is punished for its sins in the afterlife\u2019, \u2018the\nBible was written by a deity rather than by humans\u2019, \u2018the Pope is never wrong\u2019. These are all factual\nclaims. Many of the most heated religious debates, and many of the conflicts between science and\nreligion, involve such factual claims rather than ethical judgements.\nTake abortion, for example. Devout Christians often oppose abortion, whereas many liberals\nsupport it. The main bone of contention is factual rather than ethical. Both Christians and liberals\nbelieve that human life is sacred, and that murder is a heinous crime. But they disagree about certain\nbiological facts: does human life begin at the moment of conception, at the moment of birth or at some\nmiddle point? Indeed, some human cultures maintain that life doesn\u2019t begin even at birth. According\nto the !Kung of the Kalahari Desert and to various Inuit groups in the Arctic, human life begins only\nafter the person is given a name. When an infant is born people wait for some time before naming it. If\nthey decide not to keep the baby (either because it suffers from some deformity or because of\neconomic difficulties), they kill it. Provided they do so before the naming ceremony, it is not\nconsidered murder.\n2 People from such cultures might well agree with liberals and Christians that\nhuman life is sacred and that murder is a terrible crime, yet they support infanticide.\nWhen religions advertise themselves, they tend to emphasise their beautiful values. But God often\nhides in the small print of factual statements. The Catholic religion markets itself as the religion of\nuniversal love and compassion. How wonderful! Who can object to that? Why, then, are not all\nhumans Catholic? Because when you read the small print, you discover that Catholicism also\ndemands blind obedience to a pope \u2018who never makes mistakes\u2019 even when he orders us to go on\ncrusades and burn heretics at the stake. Such practical instructions are not deduced solely from ethical\njudgements. Rather, they result from conflating ethical judgements with factual statements.\nWhen we leave the ethereal sphere of philosophy and observe historical realities, we find that\nreligious stories almost always include three parts:\n1. Ethical judgements, such as \u2018human life is sacred\u2019.\n2. Factual statements, such as \u2018human life begins at the moment of conception\u2019.\n3. A conflation of the ethical judgements with the factual statements, resulting in practical guidelines\nsuch as \u2018you should never allow abortion, even a single day after conception\u2019.\nScience has no authority or ability to refute or corroborate the ethical judgements religions make. But\nscientists do have a lot to say about religious factual statements. For example, biologists are more\nqualified than priests to answer factual questions such as \u2018Do human fetuses have a nervous system\none week after conception? Can they feel pain?\u2019\nTo make things clearer, let us examine in depth a real historical example that you rarely hear about\nin religious commercials, but that had a huge social and political impact in its time. In medieval\nEurope, the popes enjoyed far-reaching political authority. Whenever a conflict erupted somewhere in\nEurope, they claimed the authority to decide the issue. To establish their claim to authority, they\nrepeatedly reminded Europeans of the Donation of Constantine. According to this story, on 30 March\n315 the Roman emperor Constantine signed an official decree granting Pope Sylvester I and his heirs\nperpetual control of the western part of the Roman Empire. The popes kept this precious document in\ntheir archive, and used it as a powerful propaganda tool whenever they faced opposition from\nambitious princes, quarrelsome cities or rebellious peasants.\nPeople in medieval Europe had great respect for ancient imperial decrees. They strongly believed\nthat kings and emperors were God\u2019s representatives, and they also believed that the older the\ndocument, the more authority it carried. Constantine in particular was revered, because he turned the\nRoman Empire from a pagan realm into a Christian empire. In a clash between the desires of some\npresent-day city council and a decree issued by the great Constantine himself, it was obvious that\npeople ought to obey the ancient document. Hence whenever the Pope faced political opposition, he\nwaved the Donation of Constantine, demanding obedience. Not that it always worked. But the\nDonation of Constantine was an important cornerstone of papal propaganda and of the medieval\npolitical order.\nWhen we examine the Donation of Constantine closely, we find that this story is composed of three\ndistinct parts:\nEthical judgement Factual statement Practical guideline\nPeople ought to respect ancient imperial decrees\nmore than present-day popular opinions.\nOn 30 March 315, Emperor Constantine granted\nthe popes dominion over Europe.\nEuropeans in 1315 ought to obey\nthe Pope\u2019s commands.\nThe ethical authority of ancient imperial decrees is far from self-evident. Most twenty-first-century\nEuropeans think that the wishes of present-day citizens trump the diktats of long-dead kings.\nHowever, science cannot join this ethical debate, because no experiment or equation can decide the\nmatter. If a modern-day scientist time-travelled to medieval Europe, she couldn\u2019t prove to our\nancestors that the decrees of ancient emperors are irrelevant to contemporary political disputes.\nYet the story of Constantine\u2019s Donation was based not just on ethical judgements. It also involved\nsome very concrete factual statements, which science is highly qualified to either verify or falsify. In\n1441 Lorenzo Valla \u2013 a Catholic priest and a pioneer linguist \u2013 published a scientific study proving\nthat Constantine\u2019s Donation was forged. Valla analysed the style and grammar of the document, and\nthe various words and terms it contained. He showed that the document included words which were\nunknown in fourth-century Latin, and that it was most probably forged about 400 years after\nConstantine\u2019s death. Moreover, the date appearing on the document is \u201830 March, in the year\nConstantine was consul for the fourth time, and Gallicanus was consul for the first time\u2019. In the\nRoman Empire, two consuls were elected each year, and it was customary to date documents by their\nconsulate years. Unfortunately, Constantine\u2019s fourth consulate was in 315, whereas Gallicanus was\nelected consul for the first time only in 317. If this all-important document was indeed composed in\nConstantine\u2019s days, it would never have contained such a blatant mistake. It is as if Thomas Jefferson\nand his colleagues had dated the American Declaration of Independence 34 July 1776.\nToday all historians agree that the Donation of Constantine was forged in the papal court sometime\nin the eighth century. Even though Valla never disputed the moral authority of ancient imperial\ndecrees, his scientific study did undermine the practical guideline that Europeans must obey the\nPope.\n3\nOn 20 December 2013 the Ugandan parliament passed the Anti-Homosexuality Act, which\ncriminalised homosexual activities, penalising some activities by life imprisonment. It was inspired\nand supported by evangelical Christian groups, which maintain that God prohibits homosexuality. As\nproof, they quote Leviticus 18:22 (\u2018Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a\nwoman; that is detestable\u2019) and Leviticus 20:13 (\u2018If a man has sexual relations with a man as one\ndoes with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their\nblood will be on their own heads\u2019). In previous centuries, the same religious story was responsible\nfor tormenting millions of people all over the world. This story can be briefly summarised as\nfollows:\nEthical judgement Factual statement Practical guideline\nHumans ought to obey God\u2019s\ncommands.\nAbout 3,000 years ago God commanded humans to avoid\nhomosexual activities.\nPeople should avoid homosexual\nactivities.\nIs the story true? Scientists cannot argue with the judgement that humans ought to obey God.\nPersonally, you may dispute it. You may believe that human rights trump divine authority, and if God\norders us to violate human rights, we shouldn\u2019t listen to Him. Yet there is no scientific experiment that\ncan decide this issue.\nIn contrast, science has a lot to say about the factual statement that 3,000 years ago the Creator of\nthe Universe commanded members of the Homo sapiens species to abstain from boy-on-boy action.\nHow do we know this statement is true? Examining the relevant literature reveals that though this\nstatement is repeated in millions of books, articles and Internet sites, they all rely on a single source:\nthe Bible. If so, a scientist would ask, who composed the Bible, and when? Note that this is a factual\nquestion, not a question of values. Devout Jews and Christians say that at least the book of Leviticus\nwas dictated by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, and from that moment onwards not a single letter was\neither added or deleted from it. \u2018But,\u2019 the scientist would insist, \u2018how can we be sure of that? After\nall, the Pope argued that the Donation of Constantine was composed by Constantine himself in the\nfourth century, when in fact it was forged 400 years later by the Pope\u2019s own clerks.\u2019\nWe can now use an entire arsenal of scientific methods to determine who composed the Bible, and\nwhen. Scientists have been doing exactly that for more than a century, and if you are interested, you\ncan read whole books about their findings. To cut a long story short, most peer-reviewed scientific\nstudies agree that the Bible is a collection of numerous different texts composed by different people\nin different times, and that these texts were not assembled into a single holy book until long after\nbiblical times. For example, whereas King David probably lived around 1000 BC, it is commonly\naccepted that the book of Deuteronomy was composed in the court of King Josiah of Judah, sometime\naround 620 BC, as part of a propaganda campaign aimed to strengthen Josiah\u2019s authority. Leviticus\nwas compiled at an even later date, no earlier than 500 BC.\nAs for the idea that the ancient Jews carefully preserved the biblical text, without adding or\nsubtracting anything, scientists point out that biblical Judaism was not a scripture-based religion at\nall. Rather, it was a typical Iron Age cult, similar to many of its Middle Eastern neighbours. It had no\nsynagogues, yeshivas, rabbis \u2013 or even a bible. Instead it had elaborate temple rituals, most of which\ninvolved sacrificing animals to a jealous sky god so that he would bless his people with seasonal\nrains and military victories. Its religious elite consisted of priestly families, who owed everything to\nbirth, and nothing to intellectual prowess. The mostly illiterate priests were busy with the temple\nceremonies, and had little time for writing or studying any scriptures.\nDuring the Second Temple period a rival religious elite was formed. Due partly to Persian and\nGreek influences, Jewish scholars who wrote and interpreted texts gained increasing prominence.\nThese scholars eventually came to be known as rabbis, and the texts they compiled were christened\n\u2018the Bible\u2019. Rabbinical authority rested on individual intellectual abilities rather than on birth. The\nclash between the new literate elite and the old priestly families was inevitable. Luckily for the\nrabbis, the Romans torched Jerusalem and its temple while suppressing the Great Jewish Revolt (AD\n70). With the temple in ruins, the priestly families lost their religious authority, their economic power\nbase and their very raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Traditional Judaism \u2013 a Judaism of temples, priests and headsplitting warriors \u2013 disappeared. Its place was taken by a new Judaism of books, rabbis and hairsplitting scholars. The scholars\u2019 main forte was interpretation. They used this ability not only to\nexplain how an almighty God allowed His temple to be destroyed, but also to bridge the immense\ngaps between the old Judaism described in biblical stories and the very different Judaism they\ncreated.\n4\nHence according to our best scientific knowledge, the Leviticus injunctions against homosexuality\nreflect nothing grander than the biases of a few priests and scholars in ancient Jerusalem. Though\nscience cannot decide whether people ought to obey God\u2019s commands, it has many relevant things to\nsay about the provenance of the Bible. If Ugandan politicians think that the power that created the\ncosmos, the galaxies and the black holes becomes terribly upset whenever two Homo sapiens males\nhave a bit of fun together, then science can help disabuse them of this rather bizarre notion.\nHoly Dogma\nIn truth, it is not always easy to separate ethical judgements from factual statements. Religions have\nthe nagging tendency to turn factual statements into ethical judgements, thereby creating terrible\nconfusion and obfuscating what should have been relatively simple debates. Thus the factual\nstatement \u2018God wrote the Bible\u2019 all too often mutates into the ethical injunction \u2018you ought to believe\nthat God wrote the Bible\u2019. Merely believing in this factual statement becomes a virtue, whereas\ndoubting it becomes a terrible sin.\nConversely, ethical judgements often hide within them factual statements that people don\u2019t bother to\nmention, because they think they have been proven beyond doubt. Thus the ethical judgement \u2018human\nlife is sacred\u2019 (which science cannot test) may shroud the factual statement \u2018every human has an\neternal soul\u2019 (which is open for scientific debate). Similarly, when American nationalists proclaim\nthat \u2018the American nation is sacred\u2019, this seemingly ethical judgement is in fact predicated on factual\nstatements such as \u2018the USA has spearheaded most of the moral, scientific and economic advances of\nthe last few centuries\u2019. Whereas it is impossible to scientifically scrutinise the claim that the\nAmerican nation is sacred, once we unpack this judgement we may well examine scientifically\nwhether the USA has indeed been responsible for a disproportionate share of moral, scientific and\neconomic breakthroughs.\nThis has led some philosophers, such as Sam Harris, to argue that science can always resolve\nethical dilemmas, because human values always hide within them some factual statements. Harris\nthinks all humans share a single supreme value \u2013 minimising suffering and maximising happiness \u2013\nand all ethical debates are factual arguments concerning the most efficient way to maximise\nhappiness.\n5\nIslamic fundamentalists want to reach heaven in order to be happy, liberals believe that\nincreasing human liberty maximises happiness, and German nationalists think that everyone would be\nbetter off if they only allowed Berlin to run this planet. According to Harris, Islamists, liberals and\nnationalists have no ethical dispute; they have a factual disagreement about how best to realise their\ncommon goal.\nYet even if Harris is right, and even if all humans cherish happiness, in practice it would be\nextremely difficult to use this insight to decide ethical disputes, particularly because we have no\nscientific definition or measurement of happiness. Consider the case of the Three Gorges Dam. Even\nif we agree that the ultimate aim of the project is to make the world a happier place, how can we tell\nwhether generating cheap electricity contributes more to global happiness than protecting traditional\nlifestyles or saving the rare Chinese river dolphin? As long as we haven\u2019t deciphered the mysteries of\nconsciousness, we cannot develop a universal measurement for happiness and suffering, and we don\u2019t\nknow how to compare the happiness and suffering of different individuals, let alone different species.\nHow many units of happiness are generated when a billion Chinese enjoy cheaper electricity? How\nmany units of misery are produced when an entire dolphin species becomes extinct? Indeed, are\nhappiness and misery mathematical entities that can be added or subtracted in the first place? Eating\nice cream is enjoyable. Finding true love is more enjoyable. Do you think that if you just eat enough\nice cream, the accumulated pleasure could ever equal the rapture of true love?\nConsequently, although science has much more to contribute to ethical debates than we commonly\nthink, there is a line it cannot cross, at least not yet. Without the guiding hand of some religion, it is\nimpossible to maintain large-scale social orders. Even universities and laboratories need religious\nbacking. Religion provides the ethical justification for scientific research, and in exchange gets to\ninfluence the scientific agenda and the uses of scientific discoveries. Hence you cannot understand the\nhistory of science without taking religious beliefs into account. Scientists seldom dwell on this fact,\nbut the Scientific Revolution itself began in one of the most dogmatic, intolerant and religious\nsocieties in history.\nThe Witch Hunt\nWe often associate science with the values of secularism and tolerance. If so, early modern Europe is\nthe last place you would have expected a scientific revolution. Europe in the days of Columbus,\nCopernicus and Newton had the highest concentration of religious fanatics in the world, and the\nlowest level of tolerance. The luminaries of the Scientific Revolution lived in a society that expelled\nJews and Muslims, burned heretics wholesale, saw a witch in every cat-loving elderly lady and\nstarted a new religious war every full moon.\nIf you travelled to Cairo or Istanbul around 1600, you would find there a multicultural and tolerant\nmetropolis, where Sunnis, Shiites, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Armenians, Copts, Jews and even\nthe occasional Hindu lived side by side in relative harmony. Though they had their share of\ndisagreements and riots, and though the Ottoman Empire routinely discriminated against people on\nreligious grounds, it was a liberal paradise compared with Europe. If you then travelled to\ncontemporary Paris or London, you would find cities awash with religious extremism, in which only\nthose belonging to the dominant sect could live. In London they killed Catholics, in Paris they killed\nProtestants, the Jews had long been driven out, and nobody in his right mind would dream of letting\nany Muslims in. And yet, the Scientific Revolution began in London and Paris rather than in Cairo and\nIstanbul.\nIt is customary to tell the history of modernity as a struggle between science and religion. In theory,\nboth science and religion are interested above all in the truth, and because each upholds a different\ntruth, they are doomed to clash. In fact, neither science nor religion cares that much about the truth,\nhence they can easily compromise, coexist and even cooperate.\nReligion is interested above all in order. It aims to create and maintain the social structure. Science\nis interested above all in power. It aims to acquire the power to cure diseases, fight wars and produce\nfood. As individuals, scientists and priests may give immense importance to the truth; but as\ncollective institutions, science and religion prefer order and power over truth. They can therefore\nmake good bedfellows. The uncompromising quest for truth is a spiritual journey, which can seldom\nremain within the confines of either religious or scientific establishments.\nIt would accordingly be far more correct to view modern history as the process of formulating a\ndeal between science and one particular religion \u2013 namely, humanism. Modern society believes in\nhumanist dogmas, and uses science not in order to question these dogmas, but rather in order to\nimplement them. In the twenty-first century the humanist dogmas are unlikely to be replaced by pure\nscientific theories. However, the covenant linking science and humanism may well crumble, and give\nway to a very different kind of deal, between science and some new post-humanist religion. We will\ndedicate the next two chapters to understanding the modern covenant between science and humanism.\nThe third and final part of the book will then explain why this covenant is disintegrating, and what\nnew deal might replace it.\n6\nThe Modern Covenant\nModernity is a deal. All of us sign up to this deal on the day we are born, and it regulates our lives\nuntil the day we die. Very few of us can ever rescind or transcend this deal. It shapes our food, our\njobs and our dreams, and it decides where we dwell, whom we love and how we pass away.\nAt first sight, modernity looks like an extremely complicated deal, hence few try to understand\nwhat they have signed up to. It\u2019s like when you download some software and are asked to sign an\naccompanying contract which is dozens of pages of legalese; you take one look at it, immediately\nscroll down to the last page, tick \u2018I agree\u2019 and forget about it. Yet in fact modernity is a surprisingly\nsimple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up\nmeaning in exchange for power.\nUp until modern times, most cultures believed that humans play a part in some great cosmic plan.\nThe plan was devised by the omnipotent gods, or by the eternal laws of nature, and humankind could\nnot change it. The cosmic plan gave meaning to human life, but also restricted human power. Humans\nwere much like actors on a stage. The script gave meaning to their every word, tear and gesture \u2013 but\nplaced strict limits on their performance. Hamlet cannot murder Claudius in Act I, or leave Denmark\nand go to an ashram in India. Shakespeare won\u2019t allow it. Similarly, humans cannot live for ever, they\ncannot escape all diseases, and they cannot do as they please. It\u2019s not in the script.\nIn exchange for giving up power, premodern humans believed that their lives gained meaning. It\nreally mattered whether they fought bravely on the battlefield, whether they supported the lawful king,\nwhether they ate forbidden foods for breakfast or whether they had an affair with the next-door\nneighbour. This created some inconveniences, of course, but it gave humans psychological protection\nagainst disasters. If something terrible happened \u2013 such as war, plague or drought \u2013 people consoled\nthemselves that \u2018We all play a role in some great cosmic drama, devised by the gods, or by the laws\nof nature. We are not privy to the script, but we can rest assured that everything happens for a\npurpose. Even this terrible war, plague and drought have their place in the greater scheme of things.\nFurthermore, we can count on the playwright that the story surely has a good ending. So even the war,\nplague and drought will work out for the best \u2013 if not here and now, then in the afterlife.\u2019\nModern culture rejects this belief in a great cosmic plan. We are not actors in any larger-than-life\ndrama. Life has no script, no playwright, no director, no producer \u2013 and no meaning. To the best of\nour scientific understanding, the universe is a blind and purposeless process, full of sound and fury\nbut signifying nothing. During our infinitesimally brief stay on our tiny speck of a planet, we fret and\nstrut this way and that, and then are heard of no more.\nSince there is no script, and since humans fulfil no role in any great drama, terrible things might\nbefall us and no power will come to save us, or give meaning to our suffering. There won\u2019t be a\nhappy ending, or a bad ending, or any ending at all. Things just happen, one after the other. The\nmodern world does not believe in purpose, only in cause. If modernity has a motto, it is \u2018shit\nhappens\u2019.\nOn the other hand, if shit just happens, without any binding script or purpose, then humans too are\nnot limited to any predetermined role. We can do anything we want \u2013 provided we can find a way. We\nare constrained by nothing except our own ignorance. Plagues and droughts have no cosmic meaning \u2013\nbut we can eradicate them. Wars are not a necessary evil on the way to a better future \u2013 but we can\nmake peace. No paradise awaits us after death \u2013 but we can create paradise here on earth, and live in\nit for ever, if we just manage to overcome some technical difficulties.\nIf we invest money in research, then scientific breakthroughs will accelerate technological\nprogress. New technologies will fuel economic growth, and a growing economy could dedicate even\nmore money to research. With each passing decade we will enjoy more food, faster vehicles and\nbetter medicines. One day our knowledge will be so vast and our technology so advanced that we\ncould distil the elixir of eternal youth, the elixir of true happiness, and any other drug we might\npossibly desire \u2013 and no god will stop us.\nThe modern deal thus offers humans an enormous temptation, coupled with a colossal threat.\nOmnipotence is in front of us, almost within our reach, but below us yawns the abyss of complete\nnothingness. On the practical level, modern life consists of a constant pursuit of power within a\nuniverse devoid of meaning. Modern culture is the most powerful in history, and it is ceaselessly\nresearching, inventing, discovering and growing. At the same time, it is plagued by more existential\nangst than any previous culture.\nThis chapter discusses the modern pursuit of power. The next chapter will examine how humankind\nhas used its growing power to somehow sneak meaning back into the infinite emptiness of the cosmos.\nYes, we moderns have promised to renounce meaning in exchange for power; but there\u2019s nobody out\nthere to hold us to our promise. We think we are smart enough to enjoy the full benefits of the modern\ndeal, without paying its price.\nWhy Bankers are Different from Vampires\nThe modern pursuit of power is fuelled by the alliance between scientific progress and economic\ngrowth. For most of history science progressed at a snail\u2019s pace, while the economy was in deep\nfreeze. The gradual increase in human population did lead to a corresponding increase in production,\nand sporadic discoveries sometimes resulted even in per capita growth, but this was a very slow\nprocess.\nIf in AD 1000 a hundred villagers produced a hundred tons of wheat, and in AD 1100, 105 villagers\nproduced 107 tons of wheat, this growth didn\u2019t change the rhythms of life or the sociopolitical order.\nWhereas today everyone is obsessed with growth, in the premodern era people were oblivious to it.\nPrinces, priests and peasants assumed that human production was more or less stable, that one person\ncould enrich himself only by pilfering somebody else and that their grandchildren were unlikely to\nenjoy a better standard of living.\nThis stagnation resulted to a large extent from the difficulties involved in financing new projects.\nWithout proper funding, it wasn\u2019t easy to drain swamps, construct bridges and build ports \u2013 not to\nmention engineer new wheat strains, discover new energy sources or open new trade routes. Funds\nwere scarce because there was little credit in those days; there was little credit because people had\nno belief in growth; and people didn\u2019t believe in growth because the economy was stagnant.\nStagnation thereby perpetuated itself.\nSuppose you live in a medieval town that suffers from annual outbreaks of dysentery. You resolve\nto find a cure. You need funding to set up a lab, buy medicinal herbs and exotic chemicals, pay\nassistants and travel to consult with famous doctors. You also need money to feed yourself and your\nfamily while you are busy with your research. But you don\u2019t have much money. You can approach the\nlocal lumberjack, blacksmith and baker and ask them to fulfil all your needs for a few years,\npromising that when you finally discover the cure and become rich, you will pay your debts.\nUnfortunately, the lumberjack, blacksmith and baker are unlikely to agree. They need to feed their\nfamilies today, and they have no faith in miracle medicines. They weren\u2019t born yesterday, and in all\ntheir years they have never heard of anyone finding a new medicine for some dreaded disease. If you\nwant provisions \u2013 you must pay cash. But how can you have enough money when you haven\u2019t\ndiscovered the medicine yet, and all your time is taken up with research? Reluctantly, you go back to\ntilling your field, dysentery keeps tormenting the townsfolk, nobody tries to develop new remedies,\nand not a single gold coin changes hands. That\u2019s how the economy froze, and science stood still.\nThe cycle was eventually broken in the modern age thanks to people\u2019s growing trust in the future,\nand the resulting miracle of credit. Credit is the economic manifestation of trust. Today, if I want to\ndevelop a new drug but I don\u2019t have enough money, I can get a loan from the bank, or turn to private\ninvestors and venture capital funds. When Ebola erupted in West Africa in the summer of 2014, what\ndo you think happened to the shares of pharmaceutical companies that were busy developing antiEbola drugs and vaccines? They skyrocketed. Tekmira shares rose by 50 per cent and BioCryst shares\nby 90 per cent. In the Middle Ages, the outbreak of a plague caused people to raise their eyes towards\nheaven, and pray to God to forgive them for their sins. Today, when people hear of some new deadly\nepidemic, they pick up the phone and call their broker. For the stock exchange, even an epidemic is a\nbusiness opportunity.\nIf enough new ventures succeed, people\u2019s trust in the future increases, credit expands, interest rates\nfall, entrepreneurs can raise money more easily and the economy grows. People consequently have\neven greater trust in the future, the economy keeps growing and science progresses with it.\nIt sounds simple on paper. Why, then, did humankind have to wait until the modern era for\neconomic growth to gather momentum? For thousands of years people had little faith in future growth\nnot because they were stupid, but because it contradicts our gut feelings, our evolutionary heritage\nand the way the world works. Most natural systems exist in equilibrium, and most survival struggles\nare a zero-sum game in which one can prosper only at the expense of another.\nFor example, each year roughly the same amount of grass grows in a given valley. The grass\nsupports a population of about 10,000 rabbits, which contains enough slow, dim-witted or unlucky\nrabbits to provide prey for a hundred foxes. If one fox is very diligent, and captures more rabbits than\nusual, then another fox will probably starve to death. If all foxes somehow manage to capture more\nrabbits simultaneously, the rabbit population will crash, and next year many foxes will starve. Even\nthough there are occasional fluctuations in the rabbit market, in the long run the foxes cannot expect to\nhunt, say, 3 per cent more rabbits per year than the preceding year.\nOf course, some ecological realities are more complex, and not all survival struggles are zero-sum\ngames. Many animals cooperate effectively, and a few even give loans. The most famous lenders in\nnature are vampire bats. These vampires congregate in their thousands inside caves, and every night\nthey fly out to look for prey. When they find a sleeping bird or a careless mammal, they make a small\nincision in its skin, and suck its blood. Not all bats find a victim every night. In order to cope with the\nuncertainty of their life, the vampires loan blood to each other. A vampire that fails to find prey will\ncome home and ask for some stolen blood from a more fortunate friend. Vampires remember very\nwell to whom they loaned blood, so at a later date if the friend comes home empty-handed, he will\napproach his debtor, who will return the favour.\nHowever, unlike human bankers, vampires never charge interest. If vampire A loaned vampire B\nten centilitres of blood, B will repay the same amount. Nor do vampires use loans in order to finance\nnew businesses or encourage growth in the blood-sucking market \u2013 because the blood is produced by\nother animals, the vampires have no way of increasing production. Though the blood market has its\nups and downs, vampires cannot presume that in 2017 there will be 3 per cent more blood than in\n2016, and that in 2018 the blood market will again grow by 3 per cent. Consequently, vampires don\u2019t\nbelieve in growth.\n1 For millions of years of evolution, humans lived under similar conditions to\nvampires, foxes and rabbits. Hence humans too find it difficult to believe in growth.\nThe Miracle Pie\nEvolutionary pressures have accustomed humans to see the world as a static pie. If somebody gets a\nbigger slice of the pie, somebody else inevitably gets a smaller slice. A particular family or city may\nprosper, but humankind as a whole is not going to produce more than it produces today. Accordingly,\ntraditional religions such as Christianity and Islam sought ways to solve humanity\u2019s problems with the\nhelp of current resources, either by redistributing the existing pie, or by promising us a pie in the sky.\nModernity, in contrast, is based on the firm belief that economic growth is not only possible but is\nabsolutely essential. Prayers, good deeds and meditation can be comforting and inspiring, but\nproblems such as famine, plague and war can only be solved through growth. This fundamental dogma\ncan be summarised in one simple idea: \u2018If you have a problem, you probably need more stuff, and in\norder to have more stuff, you must produce more of it.\u2019\nModern politicians and economists insist that growth is vital for three principal reasons. Firstly,\nwhen we produce more, we can consume more, raise our standard of living and allegedly enjoy a\nhappier life. Secondly, as long as humankind multiplies, economic growth is needed merely to stay\nwhere we are. For example, in India the annual population growth rate is 1.2 per cent. That means\nthat unless the Indian economy grows each year by at least 1.2 per cent, unemployment will rise,\nsalaries will fall and the average standard of living will decline. Thirdly, even if Indians stop\nmultiplying, and even if the Indian middle class can be satisfied with its present standard of living,\nwhat should India do about its hundreds of millions of poverty-stricken citizens? If the economy\ndoesn\u2019t grow, and the pie therefore remains the same size, you can give more to the poor only by\ntaking something from the rich. That will force you to make some very hard choices, and will\nprobably cause a lot of resentment and even violence. If you wish to avoid hard choices, resentment\nand violence, you need a bigger pie.\nModernity has turned \u2018more stuff\u2019 into a panacea applicable to almost all public and private\nproblems, from Islamic fundamentalism through Third World authoritarianism down to a failed\nmarriage. If only countries such as Pakistan and Egypt could keep a healthy growth rate, their citizens\nwould come to enjoy the benefits of private cars and bulging refrigerators, and they would take the\npath of earthly prosperity instead of following the Islamic pied piper. Similarly, economic growth in\ncountries such as Congo and Myanmar would produce a prosperous middle class which is the\nbedrock of liberal democracy. And in the case of the disgruntled couple, their marriage will be saved\nif they just buy a bigger house (so they don\u2019t have to share a cramped office), purchase a dishwasher\n(so that they stop arguing whose turn it is to do the dishes) and go to expensive therapy sessions twice\na week.\nEconomic growth has thus become the crucial juncture where almost all modern religions,\nideologies and movements meet. The Soviet Union, with its megalomaniac Five Year Plans, was as\nobsessed with growth as the most cut-throat American robber baron. Just as Christians and Muslims\nboth believed in heaven, and disagreed only about how to get there, so during the Cold War both\ncapitalists and communists believed in creating heaven on earth through economic growth, and\nwrangled only about the exact method.\nToday Hindu revivalists, pious Muslims, Japanese nationalists and Chinese communists may\ndeclare their adherence to very different values and goals, but they have all come to believe that\neconomic growth is the key for realising their disparate goals. Thus in 2014 the devout Hindu\nNarendra Modi was elected prime minister of India largely thanks to his success in boosting\neconomic growth in his home state of Gujarat, and thanks to the widely held view that only he could\nreinvigorate the sluggish national economy. Analogous views have kept the Islamist Recep Tayyip\nErdo\u011fan in power in Turkey since 2003. The name of his party \u2013 the Justice and Development Party \u2013\nhighlights its commitment to economic development, and the Erdo\u011fan government has indeed managed\nto maintain impressive growth rates for more than a decade.\nJapan\u2019s prime minister, the nationalist Shinz\u014d Abe, came to office in 2012 pledging to jolt the\nJapanese economy out of two decades of stagnation. His aggressive and somewhat unusual measures\nto achieve this have been nicknamed Abenomics. Meanwhile in neighbouring China the Communist\nParty still pays lip service to traditional Marxist\u2013Leninist ideals, but in practice it is guided by Deng\nXiaoping\u2019s famous maxims that \u2018development is the only hard truth\u2019 and that \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter if a cat\nis black or white, so long as it catches mice\u2019. Which means, in plain language: do anything it takes to\npromote economic growth, even if Marx and Lenin wouldn\u2019t have been happy with it.\nIn Singapore, as befits that no-nonsense city state, they followed this line of thinking even further,\nand pegged ministerial salaries to the national GDP. When the Singaporean economy grows, ministers\nget a raise, as if that is what their job is all about.\n2\nThis obsession with growth may sound self-evident, but only because we live in the modern world.\nIt wasn\u2019t like this in the past. Indian maharajas, Ottoman sultans, Kamakura shoguns and Han\nemperors seldom staked their political fortunes on ensuring economic growth. That Modi, Erdo\u011fan,\nAbe and Chinese president Xi Jinping all bet their careers on economic growth testifies to the almost\nreligious status growth has managed to acquire throughout the world. Indeed, it may not be wrong to\ncall the belief in economic growth a religion, because it now purports to solve many if not most of\nour ethical dilemmas. Since economic growth is allegedly the source of all good things, it encourages\npeople to bury their ethical disagreements and adopt whichever course of action maximises long-term\ngrowth. Thus Modi\u2019s India is home to thousands of sects, parties, movements and gurus, yet though\ntheir ultimate aims may differ, they all have to pass through the same bottleneck of economic growth,\nso why not pull together in the meantime?\nThe credo of \u2018more stuff\u2019 accordingly urges individuals, firms and governments to discount\nanything that might hamper economic growth, such as preserving social equality, ensuring ecological\nharmony or honouring your parents. In the Soviet Union, when people thought that state-controlled\ncommunism was the fastest way to grow, anything that stood in the way of collectivisation was\nbulldozed, including millions of kulaks, the freedom of expression and the Aral Sea. Nowadays it is\ngenerally accepted that some version of free-market capitalism is a much more efficient way of\nensuring long-term growth, hence rich farmers and freedom of expression are protected, but\necological habitats, social structures and traditional values that stand in the way of free-market\ncapitalism are destroyed and dismantled.\nTake, for example, a software engineer making $250 per hour working for some hi-tech start-up.\nOne day her elderly father has a stroke. He now needs help with shopping, cooking and even\nshowering. She could move her father to her own house, leave home later in the morning, come back\nearlier in the evening and take care of her father personally. Both her income and the start-up\u2019s\nproductivity would suffer, but her father would enjoy the care of a respectful and loving daughter.\nAlternatively, the engineer could hire a Mexican carer who, for $25 per hour, would live with the\nfather and provide for all his needs. That would mean business as usual for the engineer and her startup, and even the carer and the Mexican economy would benefit. What should the engineer do?\nFree-market capitalism has a firm answer. If economic growth demands that we loosen family\nbonds, encourage people to live away from their parents, and import carers from the other side of the\nworld \u2013 so be it. This answer, however, involves an ethical judgement rather than a factual statement.\nNo doubt, when some people specialise in software engineering while others spend their time taking\ncare of the elderly, we can produce more software and give old people more professional care. Yet is\neconomic growth more important than family bonds? By daring to make such ethical judgements, freemarket capitalism has crossed the border from the land of science to that of religion.\nMost capitalists would probably dislike the title of religion, but as religions go, capitalism can at\nleast hold its head high. Unlike other religions that promise us a pie in the sky, capitalism promises\nmiracles here on earth \u2013 and sometimes even provides them. Much of the credit for overcoming\nfamine and plague belongs to the ardent capitalist faith in growth. Capitalism even deserves some\nkudos for reducing human violence and increasing tolerance and cooperation. As the next chapter\nexplains, there are additional factors at play here, but capitalism did make an important contribution\nto global harmony by encouraging people to stop viewing the economy as a zero-sum game, in which\nyour profit is my loss, and instead see it as a win\u2013win situation, in which your profit is also my profit.\nThis has probably helped global harmony far more than centuries of Christian preaching about loving\nyour neighbour and turning the other cheek.\nFrom its belief in the supreme value of growth, capitalism deduces its number one commandment:\nthou shalt invest thy profits in increasing growth. For most of history princes and priests wasted their\nprofits on flamboyant carnivals, sumptuous palaces and unnecessary wars. Alternatively, they put\ngold coins in an iron chest, sealed it and buried it in a dungeon. Today, devout capitalists use their\nprofits to hire new employees, enlarge the factory or develop a new product.\nIf they don\u2019t know how to do it themselves, they give their money to somebody who does, such as\nbankers and venture capitalists. The latter lend the money to various entrepreneurs. Farmers take\nloans to plant new wheat fields, contractors build new houses, energy corporations explore new oil\nfields, and arms factories develop new weapons. The profits from all these activities enable the\nentrepreneurs to repay the loans with interest. We now have not only more wheat, houses, oil and\nweapons \u2013 but also more money, which the banks and funds can again lend. This wheel will never\nstop, at least not according to capitalism. We will never reach a moment when capitalism says:\n\u2018That\u2019s it. You have grown enough. You can now take it easy.\u2019 If you want to know why the capitalist\nwheel is unlikely ever to stop, talk for an hour with a friend who has just earned $100,000 and\nwonders what to do with it.\n\u2018The banks offer such low interest rates,\u2019 he would complain. \u2018I don\u2019t want to put my money in a\nsavings account that pays hardly 0.5 per cent a year. You can make perhaps 2 per cent in government\nbonds. My cousin Richie bought a flat in Seattle last year, and he has already made 20 per cent on his\ninvestment! Maybe I should go into real estate too; but everybody is saying there\u2019s a new real-estate\nbubble. So what do you think about the stock exchange? A friend told me the best deal these days is to\nbuy an ETF that follows emerging economies, like Brazil or China.\u2019 As he stops for a moment to\nbreathe, you ask, \u2018Well, why not just be satisfied with your $100,000?\u2019 He will explain to you better\nthan I can why capitalism will never stop.\nThis lesson is hammered home even to children and teenagers through ubiquitous capitalist games.\nPremodern games such as chess assumed a stagnant economy. You begin a game of chess with sixteen\npieces, and you never finish a game with more. In rare cases a pawn may be transformed into a queen,\nbut you cannot produce new pawns, nor can you upgrade your knights into tanks. So chess players\nnever have to think about investment. In contrast, many modern board games and computer games\nrevolve around investment and growth.\nParticularly telling are civilisation-style strategy games, such as Minecraft, The Settlers of Catan\nor Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization. The game may be set in the Middle Ages, in the Stone Age or in some\nimaginary fairy land, but the principles always remain the same \u2013 and they are always capitalist. Your\naim is to establish a city, a kingdom or maybe an entire civilisation. You begin from a very modest\nbase, perhaps just a village and its nearby fields. Your assets provide you with an initial income of\nwheat, wood, iron or gold. You then have to invest this income wisely. You have to choose between\nunproductive but still necessary tools such as soldiers, and productive assets such as more villages,\nfields and mines. The winning strategy is usually to invest the barest minimum in non-productive\nessentials, while maximising your productive assets. Establishing additional villages means that next\nturn you will have a larger income that would enable you not only to buy more soldiers (if necessary),\nbut simultaneously to increase your investment in production. Soon you could upgrade your villages\nto towns, build universities, harbours and factories, explore the seas and oceans, establish your\ncivilisation and win the game.\nThe Ark Syndrome\nYet can the economy actually keep growing for ever? Won\u2019t it eventually run out of resources \u2013 and\ngrind to a halt? In order to ensure perpetual growth, we must somehow discover an inexhaustible\nstore of resources.\nOne solution is to explore and conquer new lands and territories. For centuries, the growth of the\nEuropean economy and the expansion of the capitalist system indeed relied heavily on overseas\nimperial conquests. However, there are only so many islands and continents on earth. Some\nentrepreneurs hope eventually to explore and conquer new planets and even galaxies, but in the\nmeantime, the modern economy has had to find a better method of expanding.\nScience has provided modernity with the alternative. The fox economy cannot grow, because foxes\ndon\u2019t know how to produce more rabbits. The rabbit economy stagnates, because rabbits cannot make\nthe grass grow faster. But the human economy can grow because humans can discover new materials\nand sources of energy.\nThe traditional view of the world as a pie of a fixed size presupposes there are only two kinds of\nresources in the world: raw materials and energy. But in truth, there are three kinds of resources: raw\nmaterials, energy and knowledge. Raw materials and energy are exhaustible \u2013 the more you use, the\nless you have. Knowledge, in contrast, is a growing resource \u2013 the more you use, the more you have.\nIndeed, when you increase your stock of knowledge, it can give you more raw materials and energy as\nwell. If I invest $100 million searching for oil in Alaska and I find it, then I now have more oil, but\nmy grandchildren will have less of it. In contrast, if I invest $100 million researching solar energy,\nand I find a new and more efficient way of harnessing it, then both I and my grandchildren will have\nmore energy.\nFor thousands of years, the scientific road to growth was blocked because people believed that\nholy scriptures and ancient traditions already contained all the important knowledge the world had to\noffer. A corporation that believed all the oil fields in the world had already been discovered would\nnot waste time and money searching for oil. Similarly, a human culture that believed it already knew\neverything worth knowing would not bother searching for new knowledge. This was the position of\nmost premodern human civilisations. However, the Scientific Revolution freed humankind from this\nconviction. The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. Once humans realised\nhow little they knew about the world, they suddenly had a very good reason to seek new knowledge,\nwhich opened up the scientific road to progress.\nWith each passing generation, science helped discover fresh sources of energy, new kinds of raw\nmaterial, better machinery and novel production methods. Consequently, in 2016 humankind\ncommands far more energy and raw materials than ever before, and production skyrockets. Inventions\nsuch as the steam engine, the internal combustion engine and the computer have created whole new\nindustries from scratch. As we look twenty years to the future, we confidently expect to produce and\nconsume far more in 2036 than we do today. We trust nanotechnology, genetic engineering and\nartificial intelligence to revolutionise production yet again, and to open whole new sections in our\never-expanding supermarkets.\nWe therefore have a good chance of overcoming the problem of resource scarcity. The real nemesis of\nthe modern economy is ecological collapse. Both scientific progress and economic growth take place\nwithin a brittle biosphere, and as they gather steam, so the shock waves destabilise the ecology. In\norder to provide every person in the world with the same standard of living as affluent Americans,\nwe would need a few more planets \u2013 but we only have this one. If progress and growth do end up\ndestroying the ecosystem, the cost will be dear not merely to vampires, foxes and rabbits, but also to\nSapiens. An ecological meltdown will cause economic ruin, political turmoil, a fall in human\nstandards of living, and it might threaten the very existence of human civilisation.\nWe could lessen the danger by slowing down the pace of progress and growth. If this year investors\nexpect to get a 6 per cent return on their portfolios, in ten years they will be satisfied with a 3 per cent\nreturn, in twenty years only 1 per cent, and in thirty years the economy will stop growing and we\u2019ll be\nhappy with what we\u2019ve already got. Yet the creed of growth firmly objects to such a heretical idea.\nInstead, it suggests we should run even faster. If our discoveries destabilise the ecosystem and\nthreaten humanity, then we should discover something to protect ourselves. If the ozone layer\ndwindles and exposes us to skin cancer, we should invent better sunscreen and better cancer\ntreatments, thereby also promoting the growth of new sunscreen factories and cancer centres. If all the\nnew industries pollute the atmosphere and the oceans, causing global warming and mass extinctions,\nthen we should build for ourselves virtual worlds and hi-tech sanctuaries that will provide us with all\nthe good things in life even if the planet is as hot, dreary and polluted as hell.\nBeijing has already become so polluted that people avoid the outdoors, and wealthy Chinese pay\nthousands of dollars for indoor air-purifying systems. The super-rich build protective contraptions\neven over their yards. In 2013 the International School of Beijing, which caters for the children of\nforeign diplomats and upper-class Chinese, went a step further, and constructed a giant $5 million\ndome over its six tennis courts and its playing fields. Other schools are following suit, and the\nChinese air-purification market is booming. Of course most Beijing residents cannot afford such\nluxuries in their homes, nor can they afford to send their kids to the International School.\n3\nHumankind finds itself locked into a double race. On the one hand, we feel compelled to speed up\nthe pace of scientific progress and economic growth. A billion Chinese and a billion Indians want to\nlive like middle-class Americans, and they see no reason why they should put their dreams on hold\nwhen the Americans are unwilling to give up their SUVs and shopping malls. On the other hand, we\nmust stay at least one step ahead of ecological Armageddon. Managing this double race becomes\nmore difficult by the year, because every stride that brings the Delhi slum-dwellers closer to the\nAmerican Dream also brings the planet closer to the brink.\nThe good news is that for hundreds of years humankind has enjoyed a growing economy without\nfalling prey to ecological meltdown. Many other species have perished in the process, and humans\ntoo have faced a number of economic crises and ecological disasters, but so far we have always\nmanaged to pull through. Yet future success is not guaranteed by some law of nature. Who knows if\nscience will always be able to simultaneously save the economy from freezing and the ecology from\nboiling. And since the pace just keeps accelerating, the margins for error keep narrowing. If\npreviously it was enough to invent something amazing once a century, today we need to come up with\na miracle every two years.\nWe should also be concerned that an ecological apocalypse might have different consequences for\ndifferent human castes. There is no justice in history. When disaster strikes, the poor almost always\nsuffer far more than the rich, even if the rich caused the tragedy in the first place. Global warming is\nalready affecting the lives of poor people in arid African countries more than the lives of affluent\nWesterners. Paradoxically, the very power of science may increase the danger, because it makes the\nrich complacent.\nConsider greenhouse gas emissions. Most scholars and an increasing number of politicians\nrecognise the reality of global warming and the magnitude of the danger. Yet this recognition has so\nfar failed to change our actual behaviour. We talk a lot about global warming, but in practice\nhumankind is unwilling to make serious economic, social or political sacrifices to stop the\ncatastrophe. Between 2000 and 2010 emissions didn\u2019t decrease at all. On the contrary, they increased\nat an annual rate of 2.2 per cent, compared with an annual increase rate of 1.3 per cent between 1970\nand 2000.\n4 The 1997 Kyoto protocol on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions aimed merely to slow\ndown global warming rather than stop it, yet the world\u2019s number one polluter \u2013 the United States \u2013\nrefused to ratify it, and has made no attempt to significantly reduce its emissions, for fear of slowing\ndown its economic growth.\n5\nAll the talk about global warming, and all the conferences, summits and protocols, have so far failed to curb global greenhouse emissions.\nIf you look closely at the graph you see that emissions go down only during periods of economic crises and stagnation. Thus the small\ndownturn in greenhouse emissions in 2008\u20139 was due not to the signing of the Copenhagen Accord, but to the global financial crisis.\nSource: Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), European Commission.\nIn December 2015 more ambitious targets were set in the Paris Agreement, which calls for limiting\naverage temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. But many of the painful steps\nnecessary to reach this aim have conveniently been postponed to after 2030, or even to the second\nhalf of the twenty-first century, effectively passing the hot potato to the next generation. Current\nadministrations would be able to reap immediate political benefits from looking green, while the\nheavy political price of reducing emissions (and slowing growth) is bequeathed to future\nadministrations. Even so, at the time of writing (January 2016) it is far from certain that the USA and\nother leading polluters will ratify the Paris Agreement. Too many politicians and voters believe that\nas long as the economy grows, scientists and engineers could always save us from doomsday. When it\ncomes to climate change, many growth true-believers do not just hope for miracles \u2013 they take it for\ngranted that the miracles will happen.\nHow rational is it to risk the future of humankind on the assumption that future scientists will make\nsome unknown discoveries? Most of the presidents, ministers and CEOs who run the world are very\nrational people. Why are they willing to take such a gamble? Maybe because they don\u2019t think they are\ngambling on their own personal future. Even if bad comes to worse and science cannot hold off the\ndeluge, engineers could still build a hi-tech Noah\u2019s Ark for the upper caste, while leaving billions of\nothers to drown. The belief in this hi-tech Ark is currently one of the biggest threats to the future of\nhumankind and of the entire ecosystem. People who believe in the hi-tech Ark should not be put in\ncharge of the global ecology, for the same reason that people who believe in a heavenly afterlife\nshould not be given nuclear weapons.\nAnd what about the poor? Why aren\u2019t they protesting? If and when the deluge comes, they will bear\nthe full cost of it. However, they will also be the first to bear the cost of economic stagnation. In a\ncapitalist world, the lives of the poor improve only when the economy grows. Hence they are unlikely\nto support any steps to reduce future ecological threats that are based on slowing down present-day\neconomic growth. Protecting the environment is a very nice idea, but those who cannot pay their rent\nare worried about their overdraft far more than about melting ice caps.\nThe Rat Race\nEven if we go on running fast enough and manage to fend off both economic collapse and ecological\nmeltdown, the race itself creates huge problems. On the individual level, it results in high levels of\nstress and tension. After centuries of economic growth and scientific progress, life should have\nbecome calm and peaceful, at least in the most advanced countries. If our ancestors knew what tools\nand resources stand ready at our command, they would have surmised we must be enjoying celestial\ntranquillity, free of all cares and worries. The truth is very different. Despite all our achievements,\nwe feel a constant pressure to do and produce even more.\nWe blame ourselves, our boss, the mortgage, the government, the school system. But it\u2019s not really\ntheir fault. It\u2019s the modern deal, which we have all signed up to on the day we were born. In the\npremodern world, people were akin to lowly clerks in a socialist bureaucracy. They punched their\ncard, and then waited for somebody else to do something. In the modern world, we humans run the\nbusiness. So we are under constant pressure day and night.\nOn the collective level, the race manifests itself in ceaseless upheavals. Whereas previously social\nand political systems endured for centuries, today every generation destroys the old world and builds\na new one in its place. As the Communist Manifesto brilliantly put it, the modern world positively\nrequires uncertainty and disturbance. All fixed relations and ancient prejudices are swept away, and\nnew structures become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air. It isn\u2019t easy\nto live in such a chaotic world, and it is even harder to govern it.\nHence modernity needs to work hard to ensure that neither human individuals nor the human\ncollective will try to retire from the race, despite all the tension and chaos it creates. For that\npurpose, modernity upholds growth as a supreme value for whose sake we should make every\nsacrifice and risk every danger. On the collective level, governments, firms and organisations are\nencouraged to measure their success in terms of growth, and to fear equilibrium as if it were the\nDevil. On the individual level, we are inspired to constantly increase our income and our standard of\nliving. Even if you are quite satisfied with your current conditions, you should strive for more.\nYesterday\u2019s luxuries become today\u2019s necessities. If once you could live well in a three-bedroom\napartment with one car and a single desktop, today you need a five-bedroom house with two cars and\na host of iPods, tablets and smartphones.\nIt wasn\u2019t very hard to convince individuals to want more. Greed comes easily to humans. The big\nproblem was to convince collective institutions such as states and churches to go along with the new\nideal. For millennia, societies strove to curb individual desires and bring them into some kind of\nbalance. It was well known that people wanted more and more for themselves, but when the pie was\nof a fixed size, social harmony depended on restraint. Avarice was bad. Modernity turned the world\nupside down. It convinced human collectives that equilibrium is far more frightening than chaos, and\nbecause avarice fuels growth, it is a force for good. Modernity accordingly inspired people to want\nmore, and dismantled the age-old disciplines that curbed greed.\nThe resulting anxieties were assuaged to a large extent by free-market capitalism, which is one\nreason why this particular ideology has become so popular. Capitalist thinkers repeatedly calm us:\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry, it will be okay. Provided the economy grows, the invisible hand of the market will take\ncare of everything else.\u2019 Capitalism has thus sanctified a voracious and chaotic system that grows by\nleaps and bounds, without anyone understanding what is happening and where we are rushing.\n(Communism, which also believed in growth, thought it could prevent chaos and orchestrate growth\nthrough state planning. After initial successes, it eventually fell far behind the messy free-market\ncavalcade.)\nBashing free-market capitalism is high on the intellectual agenda nowadays. Since capitalism\ndominates our world, we should indeed make every effort to understand its shortcomings, before they\ncause apocalyptic catastrophes. Yet criticising capitalism should not blind us to its advantages and\nattainments. So far, it\u2019s been an amazing success \u2013 at least if you ignore the potential for future\necological meltdown, and if you measure success by the yardstick of production and growth. In 2016\nwe may be living in a stressful and chaotic world, but the doomsday prophecies of collapse and\nviolence have not materialised, whereas the scandalous promises of perpetual growth and global\ncooperation are fulfilled. Although we experience occasional economic crises and international wars,\nin the long run capitalism has not only managed to prevail, but also to overcome famine, plague and\nwar. For thousands of years priests, rabbis and muftis explained that humans cannot overcome famine,\nplague and war by their own efforts. Then along came the bankers, investors and industrialists, and\nwithin 200 years managed to do exactly that.\nSo the modern deal promised us unprecedented power \u2013 and the promise has been kept. Now what\nabout the price? In exchange for power, the modern deal expects us to give up meaning. How did\nhumans handle this chilling demand? Complying with it could easily have resulted in a dark world,\ndevoid of ethics, aesthetics and compassion. Yet the fact remains that humankind is today not only far\nmore powerful than ever, it is also far more peaceful and cooperative. How did humans manage that?\nHow did morality, beauty and even compassion survive and flourish in a world devoid of gods, of\nheaven and of hell?\nCapitalists are, again, quick to give all the credit to the invisible hand of the market. Yet the\nmarket\u2019s hand is blind as well as invisible, and by itself could never have saved human society.\nIndeed, not even a country fair can maintain itself without the helping hand of some god, king or\nchurch. If everything is for sale, including the courts and the police, trust evaporates, credit vanishes\nand business withers.\n6 What, then, rescued modern society from collapse? Humankind was salvaged\nnot by the law of supply and demand, but rather by the rise of a new revolutionary religion \u2013\nhumanism.\n7\nThe Humanist Revolution\nThe modern deal offers us power, on condition that we renounce our belief in a great cosmic plan that\ngives meaning to life. Yet when you examine the deal closely, you find a cunning escape clause. If\nhumans somehow manage to find meaning without deriving it from a great cosmic plan, this is not\nconsidered a breach of contract.\nThis escape clause has been the salvation of modern society, for it is impossible to sustain order\nwithout meaning. The great political, artistic and religious project of modernity has been to find a\nmeaning to life that is not rooted in some great cosmic plan. We are not actors in a divine drama, and\nnobody cares about us and our deeds, so nobody sets limits to our power \u2013 but we are still convinced\nour lives have meaning.\nAs of 2016, humankind indeed manages to hold the stick at both ends. Not only do we possess far\nmore power than ever before, but against all expectations, God\u2019s death did not lead to social\ncollapse. Throughout history prophets and philosophers have argued that if humans stopped believing\nin a great cosmic plan, all law and order would vanish. Yet today, those who pose the greatest threat\nto global law and order are precisely those people who continue to believe in God and His allencompassing plans. God-fearing Syria is a far more violent place than the atheist Netherlands.\nIf there is no cosmic plan, and we are not committed to any divine or natural laws, what prevents\nsocial collapse? How come you can travel for thousands of kilometres, from Amsterdam to Bucharest\nor from New Orleans to Montreal, without being kidnapped by slave-traders, ambushed by outlaws\nor killed by feuding tribes?\nLook Inside\nThe antidote to a meaningless and lawless existence was provided by humanism, a revolutionary new\ncreed that conquered the world during the last few centuries. The humanist religion worships\nhumanity, and expects humanity to play the part that God played in Christianity and Islam, and that the\nlaws of nature played in Buddhism and Daoism. Whereas traditionally the great cosmic plan gave\nmeaning to the life of humans, humanism reverses the roles, and expects the experiences of humans to\ngive meaning to the great cosmos. According to humanism, humans must draw from within their inner\nexperiences not only the meaning of their own lives, but also the meaning of the entire universe. This\nis the primary commandment humanism has given us: create meaning for a meaningless world.\nAccordingly, the central religious revolution of modernity was not losing faith in God; rather, it\nwas gaining faith in humanity. It took centuries of hard work. Thinkers wrote pamphlets, artists\ncomposed poems and symphonies, politicians struck deals \u2013 and together they convinced humanity\nthat it can imbue the universe with meaning. To grasp the depth and implications of the humanist\nrevolution, consider how modern European culture differs from medieval European culture. People in\nLondon, Paris or Toledo in 1300 did not believe that humans could determine by themselves what is\ngood and what is evil, what is right and what is wrong, what is beautiful and what is ugly. Only God\ncould create and define goodness, righteousness and beauty.\nAlthough humans were viewed as enjoying unique abilities and opportunities, they were also seen\nas ignorant and corruptible beings. Without external supervision and guidance, humans could never\nunderstand the eternal truth, and would instead be drawn to fleeting sensual pleasures and worldly\ndelusions. In addition, medieval thinkers pointed out that humans are mortal, and their opinions and\nfeelings are as fickle as the wind. Today I love something with all my heart, tomorrow I am disgusted\nby it, and next week I am dead and buried. Hence any meaning that depends on human opinion is\nnecessarily fragile and ephemeral. Absolute truths, and the meaning of life and of the universe, must\ntherefore be based on some eternal law emanating from a superhuman source.\nThis view made God the supreme source not only of meaning, but also of authority. Meaning and\nauthority always go hand in hand. Whoever determines the meaning of our actions \u2013 whether they are\ngood or evil, right or wrong, beautiful or ugly \u2013 also gains the authority to tell us what to think and\nhow to behave.\nGod\u2019s role as the source of meaning and authority was not just a philosophical theory. It affected\nevery facet of daily life. Suppose that in 1300, in some small English town, a married woman took a\nfancy to the next-door neighbour and had sex with him. As she sneaked back home, hiding a smile and\nstraightening her dress, her mind began to race: \u2018What was that all about? Why did I do it? Was it\ngood or bad? What does it imply about me? Should I do it again?\u2019 In order to answer such questions,\nthe woman was supposed to go to the local priest, confess and ask the holy father for guidance. The\npriest was well versed in scriptures, and these sacred texts revealed to him exactly what God thought\nabout adultery. Based on the eternal word of God, the priest could determine beyond all doubt that the\nwoman had committed a mortal sin, that if she doesn\u2019t make amends she will end up in hell, and that\nshe ought to repent immediately, donate ten gold coins to the coming crusade, avoid eating meat for\nthe next six months and make a pilgrimage to the tomb of St Thomas \u00e0 Becket at Canterbury. And it\ngoes without saying that she must never repeat her awful sin.\nToday things are very different. For centuries humanism has been convincing us that we are the\nultimate source of meaning, and that our free will is therefore the highest authority of all. Instead of\nwaiting for some external entity to tell us what\u2019s what, we can rely on our own feelings and desires.\nFrom infancy we are bombarded with a barrage of humanist slogans counselling us: \u2018Listen to\nyourself, follow your heart, be true to yourself, trust yourself, do what feels good.\u2019 Jean-Jacques\nRousseau summed it all up in his novel \u00c9mile, the eighteenth-century bible of feeling. Rousseau held\nthat when looking for the rules of conduct in life, he found them \u2018in the depths of my heart, traced by\nnature in characters which nothing can efface. I need only consult myself with regard to what I wish to\ndo; what I feel to be good is good, what I feel to be bad is bad.\u2019\n1\nAccordingly, when a modern woman wants to understand the meaning of an affair she is having, she\nis far less prone to blindly accept the judgements of a priest or an ancient book. Instead, she will\ncarefully examine her feelings. If her feelings aren\u2019t very clear, she will call a good friend, meet for\ncoffee and pour out her heart. If things are still vague, she will go to her therapist, and tell him all\nabout it. Theoretically, the modern therapist occupies the same place as the medieval priest, and it is\nan overworked clich\u00e9 to compare the two professions. Yet in practice, a huge chasm separates them.\nThe therapist does not possess a holy book that defines good and evil. When the woman finishes her\nstory, it is highly unlikely that the therapist will burst out: \u2018You wicked woman! You have committed a\nterrible sin!\u2019 It is equally unlikely that he will say, \u2018Wonderful! Good for you!\u2019 Instead, no matter what\nthe woman may have done and said, the therapist is most likely to ask in a caring voice, \u2018Well, how\ndo you feel about what happened?\u2019\nTrue, the therapist\u2019s bookshelf sags under the weight of Freud, Jung and the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Yet these are not holy scriptures. The DSM\ndiagnoses the ailments of life, not the meaning of life. Most psychologists believe that only human\nfeelings are authorised to determine the true meaning of our actions. Hence no matter what the\ntherapist thinks about his patient\u2019s affair, and no matter what Freud, Jung and the DSM think about\naffairs in general, the therapist should not force his views on the patient. Instead, he should help her\nexamine the most secret chambers of her heart. There and only there will she find the answers.\nWhereas medieval priests had a hotline to God, and could distinguish for us between good and evil,\nmodern therapists merely help us get in touch with our own inner feelings.\nThis partly explains the changing fortunes of the institution of marriage. In the Middle Ages,\nmarriage was considered a sacrament ordained by God, and God also authorised the father to marry\nhis children according to his wishes and interests. An extramarital affair was accordingly a brazen\nrebellion against both divine and parental authority. It was a mortal sin, no matter what the lovers felt\nand thought about it. Today people marry for love, and it is their inner feelings that give value to this\nbond. Hence, if the very same feelings that once drove you into the arms of one man now drive you\ninto the arms of another, what\u2019s wrong with that? If an extramarital affair provides an outlet for\nemotional and sexual desires that are not satisfied by your spouse of twenty years, and if your new\nlover is kind, passionate and sensitive to your needs \u2013 why not enjoy it?\nBut wait a minute, you might say. We cannot ignore the feelings of the other concerned parties. The\nwoman and her lover might feel wonderful in each other\u2019s arms, but if their respective spouses find\nout, everybody will probably feel awful for quite some time. And if it leads to divorce, their children\nmight carry the emotional scars for decades. Even if the affair is never discovered, hiding it involves\na lot of tension, and may lead to growing feelings of alienation and resentment.\nThe most interesting discussions in humanist ethics concern situations like extramarital affairs,\nwhen human feelings collide. What happens when the same action causes one person to feel good, and\nanother to feel bad? How do we weigh the feelings against each other? Do the good feelings of the\ntwo lovers outweigh the bad feelings of their spouses and children?\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you think about this particular question. It is far more important to understand\nthe kind of arguments both sides deploy. Modern people have differing ideas about extramarital\naffairs, but no matter what their position is, they tend to justify it in the name of human feelings rather\nthan in the name of holy scriptures and divine commandments. Humanism has taught us that something\ncan be bad only if it causes somebody to feel bad. Murder is wrong not because some god once said,\n\u2018Thou shalt not kill.\u2019 Rather, murder is wrong because it causes terrible suffering to the victim, to his\nfamily members, and to his friends and acquaintances. Theft is wrong not because some ancient text\nsays, \u2018Thou shalt not steal.\u2019 Rather, theft is wrong because when you lose your property, you feel bad\nabout it. And if an action does not cause anyone to feel bad, there can be nothing wrong about it. If the\nsame ancient text says that God commanded us not to make any images of either humans or animals\n(Exodus 20:4), but I enjoy sculpting such figures, and I don\u2019t harm anyone in the process \u2013 then what\ncould possibly be wrong with it?\nThe same logic dominates current debates on homosexuality. If two adult men enjoy having sex\nwith one another, and they don\u2019t harm anyone while doing so, why should it be wrong, and why\nshould we outlaw it? It is a private matter between these two men, and they are free to decide about it\naccording to their inner feelings. In the Middle Ages, if two men confessed to a priest that they were\nin love with one another, and that they never felt so happy, their good feelings would not have\nchanged the priest\u2019s damning judgement \u2013 indeed, their happiness would only have worsened the\nsituation. Today, in contrast, if two men love one another, they are told: \u2018If it feels good \u2013 do it! Don\u2019t\nlet any priest mess with your mind. Just follow your heart. You know best what\u2019s good for you.\u2019\nInterestingly enough, today even religious zealots adopt this humanistic discourse when they want\nto influence public opinion. For example, every year for the past decade the Israeli LGBT community\nholds a gay parade in the streets of Jerusalem. It is a unique day of harmony in this conflict-riven city,\nbecause it is the one occasion when religious Jews, Muslims and Christians suddenly find a common\ncause \u2013 they all fume in accord against the gay parade. What\u2019s really interesting, though, is the\nargument they use. They don\u2019t say, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t hold a gay parade because God forbids\nhomosexuality.\u2019 Rather, they explain to every available microphone and TV camera that \u2018seeing a gay\nparade passing through the holy city of Jerusalem hurts our feelings. Just as gay people want us to\nrespect their feelings, they should respect ours.\u2019\nOn 7 January 2015 Muslim fanatics massacred several staff members of the French magazine\nCharlie Hebdo, because the magazine published caricatures of the prophet Muhammad. In the\nfollowing days, many Muslim organisations condemned the attack, yet some could not resist adding a\n\u2018but\u2019 clause. For example, the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate denounced the terrorists for their use of\nviolence, and in the same breath denounced the magazine for \u2018hurting the feelings of millions of\nMuslims across the world\u2019.\n2 Note that the Syndicate did not blame the magazine for disobeying God\u2019s\nwill. That\u2019s what we call progress.\nOur feelings provide meaning not only for our private lives, but also for social and political\nprocesses. When we want to know who should rule the country, what foreign policy to adopt and\nwhat economic steps to take, we don\u2019t look for the answers in scriptures. Nor do we obey the\ncommands of the Pope or the Council of Nobel Laureates. Rather, in most countries, we hold\ndemocratic elections and ask people what they think about the matter at hand. We believe that the\nvoter knows best, and that the free choices of individual humans are the ultimate political authority.\nYet how does the voter know what to choose? Theoretically at least, the voter is supposed to\nconsult his or her innermost feelings, and follow their lead. It is not always easy. In order to get in\ntouch with my feelings, I need to filter out the empty propaganda slogans, the endless lies of ruthless\npoliticians, the distracting noise created by cunning spin doctors, and the learned opinions of hired\npundits. I need to ignore all this racket, and attend only to my authentic inner voice. And then my\nauthentic inner voice whispers in my ear \u2018Vote Cameron\u2019 or \u2018Vote Modi\u2019 or \u2018Vote Clinton\u2019 or\nwhomever, and I put a cross against that name on the ballot paper \u2013 and that\u2019s how we know who\nshould rule the country.\nIn the Middle Ages this would have been considered the height of foolishness. The fleeting feelings\nof ignorant commoners were hardly a sound basis for important political decisions. When England\nwas torn apart by the Wars of the Roses, nobody thought to end the conflict by having a national\nreferendum, in which each bumpkin and wench cast a vote for either Lancaster or York. Similarly,\nwhen Pope Urban II launched the First Crusade in 1095, he didn\u2019t claim it was the people\u2019s will. It\nwas God\u2019s will. Political authority came down from heaven \u2013 it didn\u2019t rise up from the hearts and\nminds of mortal humans.\nThe Holy Spirit, in the guise of a dove, delivers an ampulla full of sacred oil for the baptism of King Clovis, founder of the Frankish\nkingdom (illustration from the Grandes Chroniques de France, c.1380). According to the founding myth of France, this ampulla was\nhenceforth kept in Rheims Cathedral, and allsubsequent French kings were anointed with the divine oil at their coronation. Each\ncoronation thus involved a miracle, as the empty ampulla spontaneously refilled with oil. This indicated that God himself chose the king\nand gave him His blessing. If God did not want Louis IX or Louis XIV or Louis XVI to be king, the ampulla would not have refilled.\n\u00a9 Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, RC-A-02764, Grandes Chroniques de France de Charles V, folio 12v.\nWhat\u2019s true of ethics and politics is also true of aesthetics. In the Middle Ages art was governed by\nobjective yardsticks. The standards of beauty did not reflect human fads. Rather, human tastes were\nsupposed to conform to superhuman dictates. This made perfect sense in a period when people\nbelieved that art was inspired by superhuman forces rather than by human feelings. The hands of\npainters, poets, composers and architects were supposedly moved by muses, angels and the Holy\nSpirit. Many a time when a composer penned a beautiful hymn, no credit was given to the composer,\nfor the same reason it was not given to the pen. The pen was held and directed by human fingers\nwhich in turn were held and directed by the hand of God.\nMedieval scholars held on to a classical Greek theory, according to which the movements of the\nstars across the sky create heavenly music that permeates the entire universe. Humans enjoy physical\nand mental health when the inner movements of their body and soul are in harmony with the heavenly\nmusic created by the stars. Human music should therefore echo the divine melody of the cosmos,\nrather than reflect the ideas and caprices of flesh-and-blood composers. The most beautiful hymns,\nsongs and tunes were usually attributed not to the genius of some human artist but to divine\ninspiration.\nPope Gregory the Great composes the eponymous Gregorian chants. The Holy Spirit, in its favourite dove costume, sits on his right\nshoulder, whispering the chants in his ear. The Holy Spirit is the chants\u2019 true author, whereas Gregory is just a conduit. God is the ultimate\nsource of art and beauty.\nManuscript: Registrum Gregorii, c.983 \u00a9 Archiv Gerstenberg/ullstein bild via Getty Images.\nSuch views are no longer in vogue. Today humanists believe that the only source for artistic\ncreation and aesthetic value is human feelings. Music is created and judged by our inner voice, which\nneed follow neither the rhythms of the stars nor the commands of muses and angels. For the stars are\nmute, while muses and angels exist only in our own imagination. Modern artists seek to get in touch\nwith themselves and their feelings, rather than with God. No wonder then that when we come to\nevaluate art, we no longer believe in any objective yardsticks. Instead, we again turn to our\nsubjective feelings. In ethics, the humanist motto is \u2018if it feels good \u2013 do it\u2019. In politics, humanism\ninstructs us that \u2018the voter knows best\u2019. In aesthetics, humanism says that \u2018beauty is in the eye of the\nbeholder\u2019.\nThe very definition of art is consequently up for grabs. In 1917 Marcel Duchamp took an ordinary\nmass-produced urinal, named it Fountain, signed his name at the bottom, declared it a work of art and\nplaced it in a Paris museum. Medieval people would not have bothered to even argue about it. Why\nwaste oxygen on such utter nonsense? Yet in the modern humanist world, Duchamp\u2019s work is\nconsidered an important artistic milestone. In countless classrooms across the world, first-year art\nstudents are shown an image of Duchamp\u2019s Fountain, and at a sign from the teacher, all hell breaks\nloose. It is art! No it isn\u2019t! Yes it is! No way! After letting the students release some steam, the teacher\nfocuses the discussion by asking \u2018What exactly is art? And how do we determine whether something\nis a work of art or not?\u2019 After a few more minutes of back and forth, the teacher steers the class in the\nright direction: \u2018Art is anything people think is art, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\u2019 If people\nthink that a urinal is a beautiful work of art \u2013 then it is. What higher authority is there that can tell\npeople they are wrong? Today, copies of Duchamp\u2019s masterpiece are presented in some of the most\nimportant museums in the world, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the National\nGallery of Canada, the Tate Gallery in London and the Pompidou Centre in Paris. (The copies are\nplaced in the museums\u2019showrooms, not in the lavatories.)\nSuch humanist approaches have had a deep impact on the economic field as well. In the Middle\nAges, guilds controlled the production process, leaving little room for the initiative or taste of\nindividual artisans and customers. The carpenters\u2019 guild determined what was a good chair, the\nbakers\u2019 guild defined good bread, and the Meistersinger guild decided which songs were first class\nand which were rubbish. Meanwhile princes and city councils regulated salaries and prices,\noccasionally forcing people to buy fixed amounts of goods at a non-negotiable price. In the modern\nfree market, all these guilds, councils and princes have been superseded by a new supreme authority\n\u2013 the free will of the customer.\nSuppose Toyota decides to produce the perfect car. It sets up a committee of experts from various\nfields: it hires the best engineers and designers, brings together the finest physicists and economists,\nand even consults with several sociologists and psychologists. To be on the safe side, they throw in a\nNobel laureate or two, an Oscar-winning actress and some world-famous artists. After five years of\nresearch and development, they unveil the perfect car. Millions of vehicles are produced, and shipped\nto car agencies across the world. Yet nobody buys the car. Does it mean that the customers are making\na mistake, and that they don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them? No. In a free market, the customer is\nalways right. If customers don\u2019t want it, it means that it is not a good car. It doesn\u2019t matter if all the\nuniversity professors and all the priests and mullahs cry out from every pulpit that this is a wonderful\ncar \u2013 if the customers reject it, it is a bad car. Nobody has the authority to tell customers that they are\nwrong, and heaven forbid that a government would try to force citizens to buy a particular car against\ntheir will.\nWhat\u2019s true of cars is true of all other products. Listen, for example, to Professor Leif Andersson\nfrom the University of Uppsala. He specialises in the genetic enhancement of farm animals, in order\nto create faster-growing pigs, dairy cows that produce more milk, and chickens with extra meat on\ntheir bones. In an interview for the newspaper Haaretz, reporter Naomi Darom confronted Andersson\nwith the fact that such genetic manipulations might cause much suffering to the animals. Already today\n\u2018enhanced\u2019 dairy cows have such heavy udders that they can barely walk, while \u2018upgraded\u2019 chickens\ncannot even stand up. Professor Andersson had a firm answer: \u2018Everything comes back to the\nindividual customer and to the question how much the customer is willing to pay for meat . . . we must\nremember that it would be impossible to maintain current levels of global meat consumption without\nthe [enhanced] modern chicken . . . if customers ask us only for the cheapest meat possible \u2013 that\u2019s\nwhat the customers will get . . . Customers need to decide what is most important to them \u2013 price, or\nsomething else.\u2019\n3\nProfessor Andersson can go to sleep at night with a clean conscience. The fact that customers are\nbuying his enhanced animal products implies that he is meeting their needs and desires and is\ntherefore doing good. By the same logic, if some multinational corporation wants to know whether it\nlives up to its \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019 motto, it need only take a look at its bottom line. If it makes loads of\nmoney, it means that millions of people like its products, which implies that it is a force for good. If\nsomeone objects and says that people might make the wrong choice, he will be quickly reminded that\nthe customer is always right, and that human feelings are the source of all meaning and authority. If\nmillions of people freely choose to buy the company\u2019s products, who are you to tell them that they are\nwrong?\nFinally, the rise of humanist ideas has revolutionised the educational system too. In the Middle\nAges the source of all meaning and authority was external, hence education focused on instilling\nobedience, memorising scriptures and studying ancient traditions. Teachers presented pupils with a\nquestion, and the pupils had to remember how Aristotle, King Solomon or St Thomas Aquinas\nanswered it.\nHumanism in Five Images\nHumanist Politics: the voter knows best.\n\u00a9 Sadik Gulec/Shutterstock.com.\nHumanist Economics: the customer is always right.\n\u00a9 CAMERIQUE/ClassicStock/Corbis.\nHumanist Aesthetics: beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

It is\ngood to know what Aristotle, Solomon and Aquinas thought about politics, art and economics; yet\nsince the supreme source of meaning and authority lies within ourselves, it is far more important to\nknow what you think about these matters. Ask a teacher \u2013 whether in kindergarten, school or college \u2013\nwhat she is trying to teach. \u2018Well,\u2019 she will answer, \u2018I teach the kids history, or quantum physics, or\nart \u2013 but above all I try to teach them to think for themselves.\u2019 It may not always succeed, but that is\nwhat humanist education seeks to do.\nAs the source of meaning and authority was relocated from the sky to human feelings, the nature of the\nentire cosmos changed. The exterior universe \u2013 hitherto teeming with gods, muses, fairies and ghouls\n\u2013 became empty space. The interior world \u2013 hitherto an insignificant enclave of crude passions \u2013\nbecame deep and rich beyond measure. Angels and demons were transformed from real entities\nroaming the forests and deserts of the world into inner forces within our own psyche. Heaven and hell\ntoo ceased to be real places somewhere above the clouds and below the volcanoes, and were instead\ninterpreted as internal mental states. You experience hell every time you ignite the fires of anger and\nhatred within your heart; and you enjoy heavenly bliss every time you forgive your enemies, repent\nyour own misdeeds and share your wealth with the poor.\nWhen Nietzsche declared that God is dead, this is what he meant. At least in the West, God has\nbecome an abstract idea that some accept and others reject, but it makes little difference either way.\nIn the Middle Ages, without a god I had no source of political, moral and aesthetic authority. I could\nnot tell what was right, good or beautiful. Who could live like that? Today, in contrast, it is very easy\nnot to believe in God, because I pay no price for my unbelief. I can be a complete atheist, and still\ndraw a very rich mix of political, moral and aesthetical values from my inner experience.\nIf I believe in God at all, it is my choice to believe. If my inner self tells me to believe in God \u2013\nthen I believe. I believe because I feel God\u2019s presence, and my heart tells me He is there. But if I no\nlonger feel God\u2019s presence, and if my heart suddenly tells me that there is no God \u2013 I will cease\nbelieving. Either way, the real source of authority is my own feelings. So even while saying that I\nbelieve in God, the truth is I have a much stronger belief in my own inner voice.\nFollow the Yellow Brick Road\nLike every other source of authority, feelings have their shortcomings. Humanism assumes that each\nhuman has a single authentic inner self, but when I try to listen to it, I often encounter either silence or\na cacophony of contending voices. In order to overcome this problem, humanism has upheld not just a\nnew source of authority, but also a new method for getting in touch with authority and gaining true\nknowledge.\nIn medieval Europe, the chief formula for knowledge was: Knowledge = Scriptures \u00d7 Logic.\n*\nIf\nwe want to know the answer to some important question, we should read scriptures, and use our logic\nto understand the exact meaning of the text. For example, scholars who wished to know the shape of\nthe earth scanned the Bible looking for relevant references. One pointed out that in Job 38:13, it says\nthat God can \u2018take hold of the edges of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it\u2019. This implies \u2013\nreasoned the pundit \u2013 that because the earth has \u2018edges\u2019 of which we can \u2018take hold\u2019, it must be a flat\nsquare. Another sage rejected this interpretation, calling attention to Isaiah 40:22, where it says that\nGod \u2018sits enthroned above the circle of the earth\u2019. Isn\u2019t that proof that the earth is round? In practice,\nthat meant that scholars sought knowledge by spending years in schools and libraries, reading more\nand more texts, and sharpening their logic so they could understand the texts correctly.\nThe Scientific Revolution proposed a very different formula for knowledge: Knowledge =\nEmpirical Data \u00d7 Mathematics. If we want to know the answer to some question, we need to gather\nrelevant empirical data, and then use mathematical tools to analyse the data. For example, in order to\ngauge the true shape of the earth, we can observe the sun, the moon and the planets from various\nlocations across the world. Once we have amassed enough observations, we can use trigonometry to\ndeduce not only the shape of the earth, but also the structure of the entire solar system. In practice, that\nmeans that scientists seek knowledge by spending years in observatories, laboratories and research\nexpeditions, gathering more and more empirical data, and sharpening their mathematical tools so they\ncould interpret the data correctly.\nThe scientific formula for knowledge led to astounding breakthroughs in astronomy, physics,\nmedicine and countless other disciplines. But it had one huge drawback: it could not deal with\nquestions of value and meaning. Medieval pundits could determine with absolute certainty that it is\nwrong to murder and steal, and that the purpose of human life is to do God\u2019s bidding, because\nscriptures said so. Scientists could not come up with such ethical judgements. No amount of data and\nno mathematical wizardry can prove that it is wrong to murder. Yet human societies cannot survive\nwithout such value judgements.\nOne way to overcome this difficulty was to continue using the old medieval formula alongside the\nnew scientific method. When faced with a practical problem \u2013 such as determining the shape of the\nearth, building a bridge or curing a disease \u2013 we collect empirical data and analyse it mathematically.\nWhen faced with an ethical problem \u2013 such as determining whether to allow divorce, abortion and\nhomosexuality \u2013 we read scriptures. This solution was adopted to some extent by numerous modern\nsocieties, from Victorian Britain to twenty-first-century Iran.\nHowever, humanism offered an alternative. As humans gained confidence in themselves, a new\nformula for attaining ethical knowledge appeared: Knowledge = Experiences \u00d7 Sensitivity. If we\nwish to know the answer to any ethical question, we need to connect to our inner experiences, and\nobserve them with the utmost sensitivity. In practice, that means that we seek knowledge by spending\nyears collecting experiences, and sharpening our sensitivity so we could understand these\nexperiences correctly.\nWhat exactly are \u2018experiences\u2019? They are not empirical data. An experience is not made of atoms,\nmolecules, proteins or numbers. Rather, an experience is a subjective phenomenon that includes three\nmain ingredients: sensations, emotions and thoughts. At any particular moment my experience\ncomprises everything I sense (heat, pleasure, tension, etc.), every emotion I feel (love, fear, anger,\netc.) and whatever thoughts arise in my mind.\nAnd what is \u2018sensitivity\u2019? It means two things. Firstly, paying attention to my sensations, emotions\nand thoughts. Secondly, allowing these sensations, emotions and thoughts to influence me. Granted, I\nshouldn\u2019t allow every passing breeze to sweep me away. Yet I should be open to new experiences,\nand permit them to change my views, my behaviour and even my personality.\nExperiences and sensitivity build up one another in a never-ending cycle. I cannot experience\nanything if I have no sensitivity, and I cannot develop sensitivity unless I undergo a variety of\nexperiences. Sensitivity is not an abstract aptitude that can be developed by reading books or\nlistening to lectures. It is a practical skill that can ripen and mature only by applying it in practice.\nTake tea, for example. I start by drinking very sweet ordinary tea while reading the morning paper.\nThe tea is little more than an excuse for a sugar rush. One day I realise that between the sugar and the\nnewspaper, I hardly taste the tea at all. So I reduce the amount of sugar, put the paper aside, close my\neyes and focus on the tea itself. I begin to register its unique aroma and flavour. Soon I find myself\nexperimenting with different teas, black and green, comparing their exquisite tangs and delicate\nbouquets. Within a few months, I drop the supermarket labels and buy my tea at Harrods. I develop a\nparticular liking for \u2018Panda Dung tea\u2019 from the mountains of Ya\u2019an in Sichuan province, made from\nleaves of tea trees fertilised by the dung of panda bears. That\u2019s how, one cup at a time, I hone my tea\nsensitivity and become a tea connoisseur. If in my early tea-drinking days you had served me Panda\nDung tea in a Ming Dynasty porcelain goblet, I would not have appreciated it much more than\nbuilder\u2019s tea in a paper cup. You cannot experience something if you don\u2019t have the necessary\nsensitivity, and you cannot develop your sensitivity except by undergoing a long string of experiences.\nWhat\u2019s true of tea is true of all other aesthetic and ethical knowledge. We aren\u2019t born with a readymade conscience. As we pass through life, we hurt people and people hurt us, we act\ncompassionately and others show compassion to us. If we pay attention, our moral sensitivity\nsharpens, and these experiences become a source of valuable ethical knowledge about what is good,\nwhat is right and who I really am.\nHumanism thus sees life as a gradual process of inner change, leading from ignorance to\nenlightenment by means of experiences. The highest aim of humanist life is to fully develop your\nknowledge through a large variety of intellectual, emotional and physical experiences. In the early\nnineteenth century, Wilhelm von Humboldt \u2013 one of the chief architects of the modern education\nsystem \u2013 said that the aim of existence is \u2018a distillation of the widest possible experience of life into\nwisdom\u2019. He also wrote that \u2018there is only one summit in life \u2013 to have taken the measure in feeling of\neverything human\u2019.\n4 This could well be the humanist motto.\nAccording to Chinese philosophy, the world is sustained by the interplay of opposing but\ncomplementary forces called yin and yang. This may not be true of the physical world, but it is\ncertainly true of the modern world that has been created by the covenant of science and humanism.\nEvery scientific yang contains within it a humanist yin, and vice versa. The yang provides us with\npower, while the yin provides us with meaning and ethical judgements. The yang and yin of modernity\nare reason and emotion, the laboratory and the museum, the production line and the supermarket.\nPeople often see only the yang, and imagine that the modern world is dry, scientific, logical and\nutilitarian \u2013 just like a laboratory or a factory. But the modern world is also an extravagant\nsupermarket. No culture in history has ever given such importance to human feelings, desires and\nexperiences. The humanist view of life as a string of experiences has become the founding myth of\nnumerous modern industries, from tourism to art. Travel agents and restaurant chefs do not sell us\nflight tickets, hotels or fancy dinners \u2013 they sell us novel experiences. Similarly, whereas most\npremodern narratives focused on external events and actions, modern novels, films and poems often\nrevolve around feelings. Graeco-Roman epics and medieval chivalric romances were catalogues of\nheroic deeds, not feelings. One chapter told how the brave knight fought a monstrous ogre, and killed\nhim. Another chapter recounted how the knight rescued a beautiful princess from a fire-spitting\ndragon, and killed him. A third chapter narrated how a wicked sorcerer kidnapped the princess, but\nthe knight pursued the sorcerer, and killed him. No wonder that the hero was invariably a knight,\nrather than a carpenter or a peasant, for peasants performed no heroic deeds.\nCrucially, the heroes did not undergo any significant process of inner change. Achilles, Arthur,\nRoland and Lancelot were fearless warriors with a chivalric world view before they set out on their\nadventures, and they remained fearless warriors with the same world view at the end. All the ogres\nthey killed and all the princesses they rescued confirmed their courage and perseverance, but\nultimately taught them little.\nThe humanist focus on feelings and experiences, rather than deeds, transformed art. Wordsworth,\nDostoevsky, Dickens and Zola cared little for brave knights and derring-do, and instead described\nhow ordinary people and housewives felt. Some people believe that Joyce\u2019s Ulysses represents the\napogee of this modern focus on the inner life rather than external actions \u2013 in 260,000 words Joyce\ndescribes a single day in the life of the Dubliners Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, who over the\ncourse of the day do . . . well, nothing much at all.\nFew people have actually read all of Ulysses, but the same principles underpin much of our\npopular culture too. In the United States, the series Survivor is often credited (or blamed) for turning\nreality shows into a craze. Survivor was the first reality show to make it to the top of the Nielsen\nratings, and in 2007 Time magazine listed it among the hundred greatest TV shows of all time.\n5\nIn\neach season, twenty contenders in minimal swimsuits are isolated on some tropical island. They have\nto face all kinds of challenges, and each episode they vote out one of their members. The last one left\ntakes home $1 million.\nAudiences in Homeric Greece, in the Roman Empire or in medieval Europe would have found the\nidea familiar and highly attractive. Twenty challengers go in \u2013 only one hero comes out. \u2018Wonderful!\u2019\na Homeric prince, a Roman patrician or a crusader knight would have thought to himself as he sat\ndown to watch. \u2018Surely we are about to see amazing adventures, life-and-death battles and\nincomparable acts of heroism and betrayal. The warriors will probably stab each other in the back, or\nspill their entrails for all to see.\u2019\nWhat a disappointment! The back-stabbing and entrails-spilling remain just a metaphor. Each\nepisode lasts about an hour. Out of that, fifteen minutes are taken up by commercials for toothpaste,\nshampoo and cereals. Five minutes are dedicated to incredibly childish challenges, such as who can\nthrow the most coconuts into a hoop, or who can eat the largest number of bugs in one minute. The\nrest of the time the \u2018heroes\u2019 just talk about their feelings! He said she said, and I felt this and I felt\nthat. If a crusader knight had really sat down to watch Survivor, he would probably have grabbed his\nbattleaxe and smashed the TV out of boredom and frustration.\nToday we might think of medieval knights as insensitive brutes. If they lived among us, we would\nsend them to a therapist, who might help them get in touch with themselves. This is what the Tin Man\ndoes in The Wizard of Oz. He walks along the yellow brick road with Dorothy and her friends,\nhoping that when they get to Oz, the great wizard will give him a heart, while the Scarecrow wants a\nbrain and the Lion wants courage. At the end of their journey they discover that the great wizard is a\ncharlatan, and he can\u2019t give them any of these things. But they discover something far more important:\neverything they wish for is already within themselves. There is no need of some godlike wizard in\norder to obtain sensitivity, wisdom or bravery. You just need to follow the yellow brick road, and\nopen yourself to whatever experiences come your way.\nExactly the same lesson is learned by Captain Kirk and Captain Jean-Luc Picard as they travel the\ngalaxy in the starship Enterprise, by Huckleberry Finn and Jim as they sail down the Mississippi, by\nWyatt and Billy as they ride their Harley-Davidsons in Easy Rider, and by countless other characters\nin myriad other road movies who leave their home town in Pennsylvania (or perhaps New South\nWales), travel in an old convertible (or perhaps a bus), pass through various life-changing\nexperiences, get in touch with themselves, talk about their feelings, and eventually reach San\nFrancisco (or perhaps Alice Springs) as better and wiser individuals.\nThe Truth About War\nThe formula Knowledge = Experiences \u00d7 Sensitivity has changed not just our popular culture, but\neven our perception of weighty issues like war. Throughout most of history, when people wished to\nknow whether a particular war was just, they asked God, they asked scriptures, and they asked kings,\nnoblemen and priests. Few cared about the opinions and experiences of a common soldier or an\nordinary civilian. War narratives such as those of Homer, Virgil and Shakespeare focused on the\nactions of emperors, generals and outstanding heroes, and though they did not hide the misery of war,\nthis was more than compensated for by a full menu of glory and heroism. Ordinary soldiers appeared\nas either piles of bodies slaughtered by some Goliath, or a cheering crowd hoisting a triumphant\nDavid upon its shoulders.\nJean-Jacques Walter, Gustav Adolph of Sweden at the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631).\n\u00a9 DeAgostini Picture Library/Scala, Florence.\nLook, for example, at the painting above of the Battle of Breitenfeld, which took place on 17\nSeptember 1631. The painter, Jean-Jacques Walter, glorifies King Gustav Adolph of Sweden, who\nled his army that day to a decisive victory. Gustav Adolph towers over the battlefield as if he were\nsome god of war. One gets the impression that the king controls the battle like a chess player moving\npawns. The pawns themselves are mostly generic figures, or tiny dots in the background. Walter was\nnot interested in how they felt while they charged, fled, killed or died. They are a faceless collective.\nEven when painters focused on the battle itself, rather than on the commander, they still looked at it\nfrom above, and were far more concerned with collective manoeuvres than with personal feelings.\nTake, for example, Pieter Snayers\u2019s painting of the Battle of White Mountain in November 1620.\nThe painting depicts a celebrated Catholic victory in the Thirty Years War over heretical Protestant\nrebels. Snayers wished to commemorate this victory by painstakingly recording the various\nformations, manoeuvres and troop movements. You can easily tell the different units, their armament\nand their place within the order of battle. Snayers gave far less attention to the experiences and\nfeelings of the common soldiers. Like Jean-Jacques Walter, he makes us observe the battle from the\nOlympian vantage point of gods and kings, and gives us the impression that war is a giant chess game.\nPieter Snayers, The Battle of White Mountain.\n\u00a9 Bpk/Bayerische Staatsgem\u00e4ldesammlungen.\nIf you take a closer look \u2013 for which you might need a magnifying glass \u2013 you realise that The\nBattle of White Mountain is a bit more complex than a chess game. What at first sight seem to be\ngeometrical abstractions turn upon closer inspection into bloody scenes of carnage. Here and there\nyou can even spot the faces of individual soldiers running or fleeing, firing their guns or impaling an\nenemy on their pikes. However, these scenes receive their meaning from their place within the overall\npicture. When we see a cannonball smashing a soldier to bits, we understand it as part of the great\nCatholic victory. If the soldier is fighting on the Protestant side, his death is a just reward for\nrebellion and heresy. If the soldier is fighting in the Catholic army, his death is a noble sacrifice for a\nworthy cause. If we look up, we can see angels hovering high above the battlefield. They are holding\na billboard which explains in Latin what happened in this battle, and why it was so important. The\nmessage is that God helped Emperor Ferdinand II defeat his enemies on 8 November 1620.\nFor thousands of years, when people looked at war, they saw gods, emperors, generals and great\nheroes. But over the last two centuries, the kings and generals have been increasingly pushed to the\nside, and the limelight shifted onto the common soldier and his experiences. War novels such as All\nQuiet on the Western Front and war films such as Platoon begin with a young and na\u00efve recruit, who\nknows little about himself and the world, but carries a heavy burden of hopes and illusions. He\nbelieves that war is glorious, our cause is just and the general is a genius. A few weeks of real war \u2013\nof mud, and blood, and the smell of death \u2013 shatter his illusions one after another. If he survives, the\nna\u00efve recruit will leave war as a much wiser man, who no longer believes the clich\u00e9s and ideals\npeddled by teachers, film-makers and eloquent politicians.\nParadoxically, this narrative has become so influential that today it is told over and over again\neven by teachers, film-makers and eloquent politicians. \u2018War is not what you see in the movies!\u2019 warn\nHollywood blockbusters such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and Blackhawk Down.\nEnshrined in celluloid, prose or poetry, the feelings of the ordinary grunt have become the ultimate\nauthority on war, which everyone has learned to respect. As the joke goes, \u2018How many Vietnam vets\ndoes it take to change a light bulb?\u2019 \u2018You wouldn\u2019t know, you weren\u2019t there.\u2019\n6\nPainters too have lost interest in generals on horses and in tactical manoeuvres. Instead, they strive\nto depict how the common soldier feels. Look again at The Battle of Breitenfeld and The Battle of\nWhite Mountain. Now look at the following two pictures, considered masterpieces of twentiethcentury war art: The War (Der Krieg) by Otto Dix, and That 2,000 Yard Stare by Tom Lea.\nDix served as a sergeant in the German army during the First World War. Lea covered the Battle of\nPeleliu Island in 1944 for Life magazine. Whereas Walter and Snayers viewed war as a military and\npolitical phenomenon, and wanted us to know what happened in particular battles, Dix and Lea view\nwar as an emotional phenomenon, and want us to know how it feels. They don\u2019t care about the genius\nof generals or about the tactical details of this or that battle. Dix\u2019s soldier might be in Verdun or Ypres\nor the Somme \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter which, because war is hell everywhere. Lea\u2019s soldier just happens\nto be an American GI in Peleliu, but you could see exactly the same 2,000-yard stare on the face of a\nJapanese soldier in Iwo Jima, a German soldier in Stalingrad or a British soldier in Dunkirk.\nOtto Dix, The War (1929\u201332).\nStaatliche Kunstsammlungen, Neue Meister, Dresden, Germany \u00a9 Lessing Images.\nTom Lea, That 2,000 Yard Stare (1944).\nTom Lea, That 2,000 Yard Stare, 1944. Oil on canvas, 36\"x28\". LIFE Collection of Art WWII, U.S. Army Center of Military History, Ft.\nBelvoir, Virginia. \u00a9 Courtesy of the Tom Lea Institute, El Paso, Texas.\nIn the paintings of Dix and Lea, the meaning of war does not emanate from tactical movements or\ndivine proclamations. If you want to understand war, don\u2019t look up at the general on the hilltop, or at\nangels in the sky. Instead, look straight into the eyes of the common soldiers. In Lea\u2019s painting, the\ngaping eyes of a traumatised soldier open a window onto the terrible truth of war. In Dix\u2019s painting,\nthe truth is so unbearable that it must be partly concealed behind a gas mask. No angels fly above the\nbattlefield \u2013 only a rotting corpse, hanging from a ruined rafter and pointing an accusing finger.\nArtists such as Dix and Lea thus overturned the traditional hierarchy of war. In earlier times wars\ncould have been as horrific as in the twentieth century. However, even atrocious experiences were\nplaced within a wider context that gave them positive meaning. War might be hell, but it was also the\ngateway to heaven. A Catholic soldier fighting at the Battle of White Mountain could say to himself:\n\u2018True, I am suffering. But the Pope and the emperor say that we are fighting for a good cause, so my\nsuffering is meaningful.\u2019 Otto Dix employed an opposite kind of logic. He saw personal experience as\nthe source of all meaning, hence his line of thinking said: \u2018I am suffering \u2013 and this is bad \u2013 hence the\nwhole war is bad. And if the kaiser and the clergy nevertheless support the war, they must be\nmistaken.\u2019\n7\nThe Humanist Schism\nSo far we have discussed humanism as if it were a single coherent world view. In fact, humanism\nshared the fate of every successful religion, such as Christianity and Buddhism. As it spread and\nevolved, it fragmented into several conflicting sects. All humanist sects believe that human\nexperience is the supreme source of authority and meaning, yet they interpret human experience in\ndifferent ways.\nHumanism split into three main branches. The orthodox branch holds that each human being is a\nunique individual possessing a distinctive inner voice and a never-to-be-repeated string of\nexperiences. Every human being is a singular ray of light, which illuminates the world from a\ndifferent perspective, and which adds colour, depth and meaning to the universe. Hence we ought to\ngive as much freedom as possible to every individual to experience the world, follow his or her inner\nvoice and express his or her inner truth. Whether in politics, economics or art, individual free will\nshould have far more weight than state interests or religious doctrines. The more liberty individuals\nenjoy, the more beautiful, rich and meaningful is the world. Due to this emphasis on liberty, the\northodox branch of humanism is known as \u2018liberal humanism\u2019 or simply as \u2018liberalism\u2019.\n*\nIt is liberal politics that believes the voter knows best. Liberal art holds that beauty is in the eye of\nthe beholder. Liberal economics maintains that the customer is always right. Liberal ethics advises us\nthat if it feels good, we should go ahead and do it. Liberal education teaches us to think for ourselves,\nbecause we will find all the answers within us.\nDuring the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as humanism gained increasing social credibility and\npolitical power, it sprouted two very different offshoots: socialist humanism, which encompassed a\nplethora of socialist and communist movements, and evolutionary humanism, whose most famous\nadvocates were the Nazis. Both offshoots agreed with liberalism that human experience is the\nultimate source of meaning and authority. Neither believed in any transcendental power or divine law\nbook. If, for example, you asked Karl Marx what was wrong with ten-year-olds working twelve-hour\nshifts in smoky factories, he would have answered that it made the kids feel bad. We should avoid\nexploitation, oppression and inequality not because God said so, but because they make people\nmiserable.\nHowever, both socialists and evolutionary humanists pointed out that the liberal understanding of\nthe human experience is flawed. Liberals think the human experience is an individual phenomenon.\nBut there are many individuals in the world, and they often feel different things and have\ncontradictory desires. If all authority and meaning flows from individual experiences, how do you\nsettle contradictions between different such experiences?\nOn 17 July 2015 the German chancellor Angela Merkel was confronted by a teenage Palestinian\nrefugee girl from Lebanon, whose family sought asylum in Germany but faced imminent deportation.\nThe girl, Reem, told Merkel in fluent German that \u2018It\u2019s really very hard to watch how other people\ncan enjoy life and you yourself can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what my future will bring.\u2019 Merkel replied that\n\u2018politics can be tough\u2019 and explained that there are hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in\nLebanon, and Germany cannot absorb them all. Stunned by this no-nonsense reply, Reem burst out\ncrying. Merkel proceeded to stroke the desperate girl on the back, but stuck to her guns.\nIn the ensuing public storm, many accused Merkel of cold-hearted insensitivity. To assuage\ncriticism, Merkel changed tack, and Reem and her family were given asylum. In the following months,\nMerkel opened the door even wider, welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees to Germany. But\nyou can\u2019t please everybody. Soon enough she was under heavy attack for succumbing to\nsentimentalism and for not taking a sufficiently firm stand. Numerous German parents feared that\nMerkel\u2019s U-turn means their children will have a lower standard of living, and perhaps suffer from a\ntidal wave of Islamisation. Why should they risk their families\u2019 peace and prosperity for complete\nstrangers who might not even believe in the values of liberalism? Everyone feels very strongly about\nthis matter. How to settle the contradictions between the feelings of the desperate refugees and of the\nanxious Germans?\n8\nLiberals forever agonise about such contradictions. The best efforts of Locke, Jefferson, Mill and\ntheir colleagues have failed to provide us with a fast and easy solution to such conundrums. Holding\ndemocratic elections won\u2019t help, because then the question will be who would get to vote in these\nelections \u2013 only German citizens, or also millions of Asians and Africans who want to immigrate to\nGermany? Why privilege the feelings of one group over another? Likewise, you cannot resolve the\nArab\u2013Israeli conflict by making 8 million Israeli citizens and 350 million citizens of Arab League\nnations vote on it. For obvious reasons, the Israelis won\u2019t feel committed to the outcome of such a\nplebiscite.\nPeople feel bound by democratic elections only when they share a basic bond with most other\nvoters. If the experience of other voters is alien to me, and if I believe they don\u2019t understand my\nfeelings and don\u2019t care about my vital interests, then even if I am outvoted by a hundred to one, I have\nabsolutely no reason to accept the verdict. Democratic elections usually work only within populations\nthat have some prior common bond, such as shared religious beliefs and national myths. They are a\nmethod to settle disagreements between people who already agree on the basics.\nAccordingly, in many cases liberalism has fused with age-old collective identities and tribal\nfeelings to form modern nationalism. Today many associate nationalism with anti-liberal forces, but at\nleast during the nineteenth century nationalism was closely aligned with liberalism. Liberals\ncelebrate the unique experiences of individual humans. Each human has distinctive feelings, tastes\nand quirks, which he or she should be free to express and explore as long as they don\u2019t hurt anyone\nelse. Similarly, nineteenth-century nationalists such as Giuseppe Mazzini celebrated the uniqueness of\nindividual nations. They emphasised that many human experiences are communal. You cannot dance\nthe polka by yourself, and you cannot invent and preserve the German language by yourself. Using\nword, dance, food and drink, each nation fosters different experiences in its members, and develops\nits own peculiar sensitivities.\nLiberal nationalists like Mazzini sought to protect these distinctive national experiences from being\noppressed and obliterated by intolerant empires, and envisaged a peaceful community of nations, each\nfree to express and explore its communal feelings without hurting its neighbours. This is still the\nofficial ideology of the European Union, whose constitution of 2004 states that Europe is \u2018united in\ndiversity\u2019 and that the different peoples of Europe remain \u2018proud of their own national identities\u2019. The\nvalue of preserving the unique communal experiences of the German nation enables even liberal\nGermans to oppose opening the floodgates of immigration.\nOf course the alliance with nationalism hardly solved all conundrums, while it created a host of\nnew problems. How do you compare the value of communal experiences with that of individual\nexperiences? Does preserving polka, bratwurst and the German language justify leaving millions of\nrefugees exposed to poverty and even death? And what happens when fundamental conflicts erupt\nwithin nations about the very definition of their identity, as happened in Germany in 1933, in the USA\nin 1861, in Spain in 1936 or in Egypt in 2011? In such cases, holding democratic elections is hardly a\ncure-all, because the opposing parties have no reason to respect the results.\nLastly, as you dance the nationalist polka, a small but momentous step may take you from believing\nthat your nation is different from all other nations to believing that your nation is better. Nineteenthcentury liberal nationalism required the Habsburg and tsarist empires to respect the unique\nexperiences of Germans, Italians, Poles and Slovenes. Twentieth-century ultra-nationalism proceeded\nto wage wars of conquest and build concentration camps for people who dance to a different tune.\nSocialist humanism has taken a very different course. Socialists blame liberals for focusing our\nattention on our own feelings instead of on what other people experience. Yes, the human experience\nis the source of all meaning, but there are billions of people in the world, and all of them are just as\nvaluable as I am. Whereas liberalism turns my gaze inwards, emphasising my uniqueness and the\nuniqueness of my nation, socialism demands that I stop obsessing about me and my feelings and\ninstead focus on what others are feeling and about how my actions influence their experiences. Global\npeace will be achieved not by celebrating the distinctiveness of each nation, but by unifying all the\nworkers of the world; and social harmony won\u2019t be achieved by each person narcissistically\nexploring their own inner depths, but rather by each person prioritising the needs and experiences of\nothers over their own desires.\nA liberal may reply that by exploring her own inner world she develops her compassion and her\nunderstanding of others, but such reasoning would have cut little ice with Lenin or Mao. They would\nhave explained that individual self-exploration is a bourgeois indulgent vice, and that when I try to\nget in touch with my inner self, I am all too likely to fall into one or another capitalist trap. My current\npolitical views, my likes and dislikes, and my hobbies and ambitions do not reflect my authentic self.\nRather, they reflect my upbringing and social surrounding. They depend on my class, and are shaped\nby my neighbourhood and my school. Rich and poor alike are brainwashed from birth. The rich are\ntaught to disregard the poor, while the poor are taught to disregard their true interests. No amount of\nself-reflection or psychotherapy will help, because the psychotherapists are also working for the\ncapitalist system.\nIndeed, self-reflection is likely only to distance me even further from understanding the truth about\nmyself, because it gives too much credit to personal decisions and too little credit to social\nconditions. If I am rich, I am likely to conclude that it is because I made wise choices. If I suffer from\npoverty, I must have made some mistakes. If I am depressed, a liberal therapist is likely to blame my\nparents, and to encourage me to set some new aims in life. If I suggest that perhaps I am depressed\nbecause I am being exploited by capitalists, and because under the prevailing social system I have no\nchance of realising my aims, the therapist may well say that I am projecting onto \u2018the social system\u2019\nmy own inner difficulties, and I am projecting onto \u2018the capitalists\u2019 unresolved issues with my mother.\nAccording to socialism, instead of spending years talking about my mother, my emotions and my\ncomplexes, I should ask myself: who owns the means of production in my country? What are its main\nexports and imports? What\u2019s the connection between the ruling politicians and international banking?\nOnly by understanding the surrounding socio-economic system and taking into account the experiences\nof all other people could I truly understand what I feel, and only by common action can we change the\nsystem. Yet what person can take into account the experiences of all human beings, and weigh them\none against the other in a fair way?\nThat\u2019s why socialists discourage self-exploration, and advocate the establishment of strong\ncollective institutions \u2013 such as socialist parties and trade unions \u2013 that aim to decipher the world for\nus. Whereas in liberal politics the voter knows best, and in liberal economics the customer is always\nright, in socialist politics the party knows best, and in socialist economics the trade union is always\nright. Authority and meaning still come from human experience \u2013 both the party and the trade union\nare composed of people and work to alleviate human misery \u2013 yet individuals must listen to the party\nand the trade union rather than to their personal feelings.\nEvolutionary humanism has a different solution to the problem of conflicting human experiences.\nRooting itself in the firm ground of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it says that conflict is something to\napplaud rather than lament. Conflict is the raw material of natural selection, which pushes evolution\nforward. Some humans are simply superior to others, and when human experiences collide, the fittest\nhumans should steamroll everyone else. The same logic that drives humankind to exterminate wild\nwolves and to ruthlessly exploit domesticated sheep also mandates the oppression of inferior humans\nby their superiors. It\u2019s a good thing that Europeans conquer Africans and that shrewd businessmen\ndrive the dim-witted to bankruptcy. If we follow this evolutionary logic, humankind will gradually\nbecome stronger and fitter, eventually giving rise to superhumans. Evolution didn\u2019t stop with Homo\nsapiens \u2013 there is still a long way to go. However, if in the name of human rights or human equality\nwe emasculate the fittest humans, it will prevent the rise of the superman, and may even cause the\ndegeneration and extinction of Homo sapiens.\nWho exactly are these superior humans who herald the coming of the superman? They might be\nentire races, particular tribes or exceptional individual geniuses. In any case, what makes them\nsuperior is that they have better abilities, manifested in the creation of new knowledge, more\nadvanced technology, more prosperous societies or more beautiful art. The experience of an Einstein\nor a Beethoven is far more valuable than that of a drunken good-for-nothing, and it is ludicrous to\ntreat them as if they have equal merit. Similarly, if a particular nation has consistently spearheaded\nhuman progress, we should rightly consider it superior to other nations that contributed little or\nnothing to the evolution of humankind.\nConsequently, in contrast to liberal artists like Otto Dix, evolutionary humanism thinks that the\nhuman experience of war is valuable and even essential. The movie The Third Man takes place in\nVienna immediately after the end of the Second World War. Reflecting on the recent conflict, the\ncharacter Harry Lime says: \u2018After all, it\u2019s not that awful . . . In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias\nthey had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci\nand the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, they had 500 years of democracy and\npeace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\u2019 Lime gets almost all his facts wrong \u2013\nSwitzerland was probably the most bloodthirsty corner of early modern Europe (its main export was\nmercenary soldiers), and the cuckoo clock was actually invented by the Germans \u2013 but the facts are of\nlesser importance than Lime\u2019s idea, namely that the experience of war pushes humankind to new\nachievements. War allows natural selection free rein at last. It exterminates the weak and rewards the\nfierce and the ambitious. War exposes the truth about life, and awakens the will for power, for glory\nand for conquest. Nietzsche summed it up by saying that war is \u2018the school of life\u2019 and that \u2018what does\nnot kill me makes me stronger\u2019.\nSimilar ideas were expressed by Lieutenant Henry Jones of the British army. Three days before his\ndeath on the Western Front in the First World War, the twenty-one-year-old Jones sent a letter to his\nbrother, describing the experience of war in glowing terms:\nHave you ever reflected on the fact that, despite the horrors of war, it is at least a big thing? I\nmean to say that in it one is brought face to face with realities. The follies, selfishness, luxury\nand general pettiness of the vile commercial sort of existence led by nine-tenths of the people of\nthe world in peacetime are replaced in war by a savagery that is at least more honest and\noutspoken. Look at it this way: in peacetime one just lives one\u2019s own little life, engaged in\ntrivialities, worrying about one\u2019s own comfort, about money matters, and all that sort of thing \u2013\njust living for one\u2019s own self. What a sordid life it is! In war, on the other hand, even if you do\nget killed you only anticipate the inevitable by a few years in any case, and you have the\nsatisfaction of knowing that you have \u2018pegged out\u2019 in the attempt to help your country. You have,\nin fact, realised an ideal, which, as far as I can see, you very rarely do in ordinary life. The\nreason is that ordinary life runs on a commercial and selfish basis; if you want to \u2018get on\u2019, as the\nsaying is, you can\u2019t keep your hands clean.\nPersonally, I often rejoice that the War has come my way. It has made me realise what a petty\nthing life is. I think that the War has given to everyone a chance to \u2018get out of himself\u2019, as I might\nsay . . . Certainly, speaking for myself, I can say that I have never in all my life experienced such\na wild exhilaration as on the commencement of a big stunt, like the last April one for example.\nThe excitement for the last half-hour or so before it is like nothing on earth.\n9\nIn his bestseller Black Hawk Down, the journalist Mark Bowden relates in similar terms the\ncombat experience of Shawn Nelson, an American soldier, in Mogadishu in 1993:\nIt was hard to describe how he felt . . . it was like an epiphany. Close to death, he had never felt\nso completely alive. There had been split seconds in his life when he\u2019d felt death brush past,\nlike when another fast-moving car veered from around a sharp curve and just missed hitting him\nhead on. On this day he had lived with that feeling, with death breathing right in his face . . . for\nmoment after moment after moment, for three hours or more . . . Combat was . . . a state of\ncomplete mental and physical awareness. In those hours on the street he had not been Shawn\nNelson, he had no connection to the larger world, no bills to pay, no emotional ties, nothing. He\nhad just been a human being staying alive from one nanosecond to the next, drawing one breath\nafter another, fully aware that each one might be his last. He felt he would never be the same.\n10\nAdolf Hitler too was changed and enlightened by his war experiences. In Mein Kampf, he tells\nhow shortly after his unit reached the front line, the soldiers\u2019 initial enthusiasm turned into fear,\nagainst which each soldier had to wage a relentless inner war, straining every nerve to avoid being\noverwhelmed by it. Hitler says that he won this inner war by the winter of 1915/16. \u2018At last,\u2019 he\nwrites, \u2018my will was undisputed master . . . I was now calm and determined. And this was enduring.\nNow Fate could bring on the ultimate tests without my nerves shattering or my reason failing.\u2019\n11\nThe experience of war revealed to Hitler the truth about the world: it is a jungle run by the\nremorseless laws of natural selection. Those who refuse to recognise this truth cannot survive. If you\nwish to succeed, you must not only understand the laws of the jungle, but embrace them joyfully. It\nshould be stressed that just like the anti-war liberal artists, Hitler too sanctified the experience of\nordinary soldiers. Indeed, Hitler\u2019s political career is one of the best examples we have for the\nimmense authority accorded to the personal experience of common people in twentieth-century\npolitics. Hitler wasn\u2019t a senior officer \u2013 in four years of war, he rose no higher than the rank of\ncorporal. He had no formal education, no professional skills and no political background. He wasn\u2019t\na successful businessman or a union activist, he didn\u2019t have friends or relatives in high places, or any\nmoney to speak of. At first, he didn\u2019t even have German citizenship. He was a penniless immigrant.\nWhen Hitler appealed to the German voters and asked for their trust, he could muster only one\nargument in his favour: his experiences in the trenches had taught him what you can never learn at\nuniversity, at general headquarters or at a government ministry. People followed him, and voted for\nhim, because they identified with him, and because they too believed that the world is a jungle, and\nthat what doesn\u2019t kill us only makes us stronger.\nWhereas liberalism merged with the milder versions of nationalism to protect the unique\nexperiences of each human community, evolutionary humanists such as Hitler identified particular\nnations as the engines of human progress, and concluded that these nations ought to bludgeon or even\nexterminate anyone standing in their way. It should be remembered, though, that Hitler and the Nazis\nrepresent only one extreme version of evolutionary humanism. Just as Stalin\u2019s gulags do not\nautomatically nullify every socialist idea and argument, so too the horrors of Nazism should not blind\nus to whatever insights evolutionary humanism might offer. Nazism was born from the pairing of\nevolutionary humanism with particular racial theories and ultra-nationalist emotions. Not all\nevolutionary humanists are racists, and not every belief in humankind\u2019s potential for further evolution\nnecessarily calls for setting up police states and concentration camps.\nAuschwitz should serve as a blood-red warning sign rather than as a black curtain that hides entire\nsections of the human horizon. Evolutionary humanism played an important part in the shaping of\nmodern culture, and it is likely to play an even greater role in the shaping of the twenty-first century.\nIs Beethoven Better than Chuck Berry?\nTo make sure we understand the difference between the three humanist branches, let\u2019s compare a few\nhuman experiences.\nExperience no. 1: A musicology professor sits in the Vienna Opera House, listening to the opening\nof Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony. \u2018Pa pa pa PAM!\u2019 As the sound waves hit his eardrums, signals travel\nvia the auditory nerve to the brain, and the adrenal gland floods his bloodstream with adrenaline. His\nheartbeat accelerates, his breathing intensifies, the hairs on his neck stand up, and a shiver runs down\nhis spine. \u2018Pa pa pa PAM!\u2019\nExperience no. 2: It\u2019s 1965. A Mustang convertible is speeding down the Pacific road from San\nFrancisco to LA at full throttle. The young macho driver puts on Chuck Berry at full volume: \u2018Go! Go,\nJohnny, go, go!\u2019 As the sound waves hit his eardrums, signals travel via the auditory nerve to the\nbrain, and the adrenal gland floods his bloodstream with adrenaline. His heartbeat accelerates, his\nbreathing intensifies, the hairs on his neck stand up, and a shiver runs down his spine. \u2018Go! Go,\nJohnny, go, go!\u2019\nExperience no. 3: Deep in the Congolese rainforest, a pygmy hunter stands transfixed. From the\nnearby village, he hears a choir of girls singing their initiation song. \u2018Ye oh, oh. Ye oh, eh.\u2019 As the\nsound waves hit his eardrums, signals travel via the auditory nerve to the brain, and the adrenal gland\nfloods his bloodstream with adrenaline. His heartbeat accelerates, his breathing intensifies, the hairs\non his neck stand up, and a shiver runs down his spine. \u2018Ye oh, oh. Ye oh, eh.\u2019\nExperience no. 4: It\u2019s a full-moon night, somewhere in the Canadian Rockies. A wolf is standing on\na hilltop, listening to the howls of a female in heat. \u2018Awoooooo! Awoooooo!\u2019 As the sound waves hit\nhis eardrums, signals travel via the auditory nerve to the brain, and the adrenal gland floods his\nbloodstream with adrenaline. His heartbeat accelerates, his breathing intensifies, the hairs on his neck\nstand up, and a shiver runs down his spine. \u2018Awoooooo! Awoooooo!\u2019\nWhich of these four experiences is the most valuable?\nIf you are liberal, you will tend to say that the experiences of the musicology professor, of the\nyoung driver and of the Congolese hunter are all equally valuable, and all should be equally\ncherished. Every human experience contributes something unique, and enriches the world with new\nmeaning. Some people like classical music, others love rock and roll, and still others prefer\ntraditional African chants. Music students should be exposed to the widest possible range of genres,\nand at the end of the day, everyone could go to the iTunes store, punch in their credit card number and\nbuy what they like. Beauty is in the ears of the listener, and the customer is always right. The wolf,\nthough, isn\u2019t human, hence his experiences are far less valuable. That\u2019s why the life of a wolf is worth\nless than the life of a human, and why it is perfectly okay to kill a wolf in order to save a human.\nWhen all is said and done, wolves don\u2019t get to vote in any beauty contests, nor do they hold any credit\ncards.\nThis liberal approach is manifested, for example, in the Voyager golden record. In 1977 the\nAmericans launched the space probe Voyager I on a journey to outer space. By now it has left the\nsolar system, making it the first man-made object to traverse interstellar space. Besides state-of-theart scientific equipment, NASA placed on board a golden record, aimed to introduce planet Earth to\nany inquisitive aliens who might encounter the probe.\nThe record contains a variety of scientific and cultural information about Earth and its inhabitants,\nsome images and voices, and several dozen pieces of music from around the world, which are\nsupposed to represent a fair sample of earthly artistic achievement. The musical sample mixes in no\nobvious order classical pieces including the opening movement of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony,\ncontemporary popular music including Chuck Berry\u2019s \u2018Johnny B. Goode\u2019, and traditional music from\nthroughout the world, including an initiation song of Congolese pygmy girls. Though the record also\ncontains some canine howls, they are not part of the music sample, but rather relegated to a different\nsection that also includes the sounds of wind, rain and surf. The message to potential listeners in\nAlpha Centauri is that Beethoven, Chuck Berry and the pygmy initiation song are of equal merit,\nwhereas wolf howls belong to an altogether different category.\nIf you are socialist, you will probably agree with the liberals that the wolf\u2019s experience is of little\nvalue. But your attitude towards the three human experiences will be quite different. A socialist truebeliever will explain that the real value of music depends not on the experiences of the individual\nlistener, but on the impact it has on the experiences of other people and of society as a whole. As Mao\nsaid, \u2018There is no such thing as art for art\u2019s sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached\nfrom or independent of politics.\u2019\n12\nSo when coming to evaluate the musical experiences, a socialist will focus, for example, on the\nfact that Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony for an audience of upper-class white Europeans,\nexactly when Europe was about to embark on its conquest of Africa. His symphony reflected\nEnlightenment ideals, which glorified upper-class white men, and branded the conquest of Africa as\n\u2018the white man\u2019s burden\u2019.\nRock and roll \u2013 the socialists will say \u2013 was pioneered by downtrodden African American\nmusicians who drew inspiration from genres like blues, jazz and gospel. However, in the 1950s and\n1960s rock and roll was hijacked by mainstream white America, and pressed into the service of\nconsumerism, of American imperialism and of Coca-Colonisation. Rock and roll was\ncommercialised and appropriated by privileged white teenagers in their petit-bourgeois fantasy of\nrebellion. Chuck Berry himself bowed to the dictates of the capitalist juggernaut. While he originally\nsang about \u2018a coloured boy named Johnny B. Goode\u2019, under pressure from white-owned radio\nstations Berry changed the lyrics to \u2018a country boy named Johnny B. Goode\u2019.\nAs for the choir of Congolese pygmy girls \u2013 their initiation songs are part of a patriarchal power\nstructure that brainwashes both men and women to conform to an oppressive gender order. And if a\nrecording of such an initiation song ever makes it to the global marketplace, it merely serves to\nreinforce Western colonial fantasies about Africa in general and about African women in particular.\nSo which music is best: Beethoven\u2019s Fifth, \u2018Johnny B. Goode\u2019 or the pygmy initiation song? Should\nthe government finance the building of opera houses, rock and roll venues or African-heritage\nexhibitions? And what should we teach music students in schools and colleges? Well, don\u2019t ask me.\nAsk the party\u2019s cultural commissar.\nWhereas liberals tiptoe around the minefield of cultural comparisons, fearful of committing some\npolitically incorrect faux pas, and whereas socialists leave it to the party to find the right path through\nthe minefield, evolutionary humanists gleefully jump right in, setting off all the mines and relishing the\nmayhem. They may start by pointing out that both liberals and socialists draw the line at other\nanimals, and have no trouble admitting that humans are superior to wolves, and that consequently\nhuman music is far more valuable than wolf howls. Yet humankind itself is not exempt from the forces\nof evolution. Just as humans are superior to wolves, so some human cultures are more advanced than\nothers. There is an unambiguous hierarchy of human experiences, and we shouldn\u2019t be apologetic\nabout it. The Taj Mahal is more beautiful than a straw hut, Michelangelo\u2019s David is superior to my\nfive-year-old niece\u2019s latest clay figurine, and Beethoven composed far better music than Chuck Berry\nor the Congolese pygmies. There, we\u2019ve said it!\nAccording to evolutionary humanists, anyone arguing that all human experiences are equally\nvaluable is either an imbecile or a coward. Such vulgarity and timidity will lead only to the\ndegeneration and extinction of humankind, as human progress is impeded in the name of cultural\nrelativism or social equality. If liberals or socialists had lived in the Stone Age, they would probably\nhave seen little merit in the murals of Lascaux and Altamira, and would have insisted that they are in\nno way superior to Neanderthal doodles.\nThe Humanist Wars of Religion\nInitially, the differences between liberal humanism, socialist humanism and evolutionary humanism\nseemed rather frivolous. Set against the enormous gap separating all humanist sects from Christianity,\nIslam or Hinduism, the arguments between different versions of humanism were trifling. As long as\nwe all agree that God is dead and that only the human experience gives meaning to the universe, does\nit really matter whether we think that all human experiences are equal or that some are superior to\nothers? Yet as humanism conquered the world, these internal schisms widened, and eventually flared\nup into the deadliest war of religion in history.\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, the liberal orthodoxy was still confident of its strength.\nLiberals were convinced that if we only gave individuals maximum freedom to express themselves\nand follow their hearts, the world would enjoy unprecedented peace and prosperity. It may take time\nto completely dismantle the fetters of traditional hierarchies, obscurantist religions and brutal\nempires, but every decade would bring new liberties and achievements, and eventually we would\ncreate paradise on earth. In the halcyon days of June 1914, liberals thought history was on their side.\nBy Christmas 1914 liberals were shell-shocked, and in the following decades their ideas were\nsubjected to a double assault from both left and right. Socialists argued that liberalism is in fact a fig\nleaf for a ruthless, exploitative and racist system. For vaunted \u2018liberty\u2019, read \u2018property\u2019. The defence\nof the individual\u2019s right to do what feels good amounts in most cases to safeguarding the property and\nprivileges of the middle and upper classes. What good is the liberty to live where you want, when\nyou cannot pay the rent; to study what interests you, when you cannot afford the tuition fees; and to\ntravel where you fancy, when you cannot buy a car? Under liberalism, went a famous quip, everyone\nis free to starve. Even worse, by encouraging people to view themselves as isolated individuals,\nliberalism separates them from their other class members, and prevents them from uniting against the\nsystem that oppresses them. Liberalism thereby perpetuates inequality, condemning the masses to\npoverty and the elite to alienation.\nWhile liberalism staggered under this left punch, evolutionary humanism struck from the right.\nRacists and fascists blamed both liberalism and socialism for subverting natural selection and\ncausing the degeneration of humankind. They warned that if all humans were given equal value and\nequal breeding opportunities, natural selection would cease to function. The fittest humans would be\nsubmerged in an ocean of mediocrity, and instead of evolving into superman, humankind would\nbecome extinct.\nFrom 1914 to 1989 a murderous war of religion raged between the three humanist sects, and\nliberalism at first sustained one defeat after the other. Not only did communist and fascist regimes\ntake over numerous countries, but the core liberal ideas were exposed as na\u00efve at best, if not\ndownright dangerous. Just give freedom to individuals and the world will enjoy peace and\nprosperity? Yeah, right.\nThe Second World War, which with hindsight we remember as a great liberal victory, hardly\nlooked like that at the time. The war began as a conflict between a mighty liberal alliance and an\nisolated Nazi Germany. (Until June 1940, even Fascist Italy preferred to play a waiting game.) The\nliberal alliance enjoyed overwhelming numerical and economic superiority. While German GDP in\n1940 stood at $387 million, the GDP of Germany\u2019s European opponents totalled $631 million (not\nincluding the GDP of the overseas British dominions and of the British, French, Dutch and Belgian\nempires). Still, in the spring of 1940 it took Germany a mere three months to deal the liberal alliance\na decisive blow, and occupy France, the Low Countries, Norway and Denmark. The UK was saved\nfrom a similar fate only by the English Channel.\n13\nThe Germans were eventually beaten only when the liberal countries allied themselves with the\nSoviet Union, which bore the brunt of the conflict and paid a much higher price: 25 million Soviet\ncitizens died in the war, compared to half a million Britons and half a million Americans. Much of the\ncredit for defeating Nazism should be given to communism. And at least in the short term, communism\nwas also the great beneficiary of the war.\nThe Soviet Union entered the war as an isolated communist pariah. It emerged as one of the two\nglobal superpowers, and the leader of an expanding international bloc. By 1949 eastern Europe\nbecame a Soviet satellite, the Chinese Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War, and the United\nStates was gripped by anti-communist hysteria. Revolutionary and anti-colonial movements\nthroughout the world looked longingly towards Moscow and Beijing, while liberalism became\nidentified with the racist European empires. As these empires collapsed, they were usually replaced\nby either military dictatorships or socialist regimes, not liberal democracies. In 1956 the Soviet\npremier, Nikita Khrushchev, confidently told the liberal West that \u2018Whether you like it or not, history\nis on our side. We will bury you!\u2019\nKhrushchev sincerely believed this, as did increasing numbers of Third World leaders and First\nWorld intellectuals. In the 1960s and 1970s the word \u2018liberal\u2019 became a term of abuse in many\nWestern universities. North America and western Europe experienced growing social unrest, as\nradical left-wing movements strove to undermine the liberal order. Students in Paris, London, Rome\nand the People\u2019s Republic of Berkeley thumbed through Chairman Mao\u2019s Little Red Book, and hung\nChe Guevara\u2019s heroic portrait over their beds. In 1968 the wave crested with the outbreak of protests\nand riots all over the Western world. Mexican security forces killed dozens of students in the\nnotorious Tlatelolco Massacre, students in Rome fought the Italian police in the so-called Battle of\nValle Giulia, and the assassination of Martin Luther King sparked days of riots and protests in more\nthan a hundred American cities. In May students took over the streets of Paris, President de Gaulle\nfled to a French military base in Germany, and well-to-do French citizens trembled in their beds,\nhaving guillotine nightmares.\nBy 1970 the world contained 130 independent countries, but only thirty of these were liberal\ndemocracies, most of which were crammed into the north-western corner of Europe. India was the\nonly important Third World country that committed to the liberal path after securing its independence,\nbut even India distanced itself from the Western bloc, and leaned towards the Soviets.\nIn 1975 the liberal camp suffered its most humiliating defeat of all: the Vietnam War ended with the\nNorth Vietnamese David overcoming the American Goliath. In quick succession communism took\nover South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. On 17 April 1975 the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, fell\nto the Khmer Rouge. Two weeks later, people all over the world watched as helicopters evacuated\nthe last Yankees from the rooftop of the American Embassy in Saigon. Many were certain that the\nAmerican Empire was falling. Before anyone could say \u2018domino theory\u2019, on 25 June Indira Gandhi\nproclaimed the Emergency in India, and it seemed that the world\u2019s largest democracy was on its way\nto becoming yet another socialist dictatorship.\nLiberal democracy increasingly looked like an exclusive club for ageing white imperialists, who\nhad little to offer the rest of the world, or even their own youth. Washington presented itself as the\nleader of the free world, but most of its allies were either authoritarian kings (such as King Khaled of\nSaudi Arabia, King Hassan of Morocco and the Persian shah) or military dictators (such as the Greek\ncolonels, General Pinochet in Chile, General Franco in Spain, General Park in South Korea, General\nGeisel in Brazil and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan).\nDespite the support of all these colonels and generals, militarily the Warsaw Pact had a huge\nnumerical superiority over NATO. In order to reach parity in conventional armament, Western\ncountries would probably have had to scrap liberal democracy and the free market, and become\ntotalitarian states on a permanent war footing. Liberal democracy was saved only by nuclear\nweapons. NATO adopted the doctrine of MAD (mutual assured destruction), according to which even\nconventional Soviet attacks would be answered by an all-out nuclear strike. \u2018If you attack us,\u2019\nthreatened the liberals, \u2018we will make sure nobody comes out of it alive.\u2019 Behind this monstrous\nshield, liberal democracy and the free market managed to hold out in their last bastions, and\nWesterners could enjoy sex, drugs and rock and roll, as well as washing machines, refrigerators and\ntelevisions. Without nukes, there would have been no Woodstock, no Beatles and no overflowing\nsupermarkets. But in the mid-1970s it seemed that nuclear weapons notwithstanding, the future\nbelonged to socialism.\nThe evacuation of the American Embassy in Saigon.\n\u00a9 Bettmann/Corbis.\nAnd then everything changed. Liberal democracy crawled out of history\u2019s dustbin, cleaned itself up\nand conquered the world. The supermarket proved to be far stronger than the gulag. The blitzkrieg\nbegan in southern Europe, where the authoritarian regimes in Greece, Spain and Portugal collapsed,\ngiving way to democratic governments. In 1977 Indira Gandhi ended the Emergency, re-establishing\ndemocracy in India. During the 1980s military dictatorships in East Asia and Latin America were\nreplaced by democratic governments in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Taiwan and South Korea.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the liberal wave turned into a veritable tsunami, sweeping away the\nmighty Soviet Empire, and raising expectations of the coming end of history. After decades of defeats\nand setbacks, liberalism won a decisive victory in the Cold War, emerging triumphant from the\nhumanist wars of religion, albeit a bit worse for wear.\nAs the Soviet Empire imploded, liberal democracies replaced communist regimes not only in\neastern Europe, but also in many of the former Soviet republics, such as the Baltic States, Ukraine,\nGeorgia and Armenia. Even Russia nowadays pretends to be a democracy. Victory in the Cold War\ngave renewed impetus for the spread of the liberal model elsewhere around the world, most notably\nin Latin America, South Asia and Africa. Some liberal experiments ended in abject failures, but the\nnumber of success stories is impressive. For instance, Indonesia, Nigeria and Chile have been ruled\nby military strongmen for decades, but all are now functioning democracies.\nIf a liberal had fallen asleep in June 1914 and woken up in June 2014, he or she would have felt\nvery much at home. Once again people believe that if you just give individuals more freedom, the\nworld will enjoy peace and prosperity. The entire twentieth century looks like a big mistake.\nHumankind was speeding on the liberal highway back in the summer of 1914, when it took a wrong\nturn and entered a cul-de-sac. It then needed eight decades and three horrendous global wars to find\nits way back to the highway. Of course, these decades were not a total waste, as they did give us\nantibiotics, nuclear energy and computers, as well as feminism, de-colonialism and free sex. In\naddition, liberalism itself smarted from the experience, and is less conceited than it was a century\nago. It has adopted various ideas and institutions from its socialist and fascist rivals, in particular a\ncommitment to provide the general public with education, health and welfare services. Yet the core\nliberal package has changed surprisingly little. Liberalism still sanctifies individual liberties above\nall, and still has a firm belief in the voter and the customer. In the early twenty-first century, this is the\nonly show in town.\nElectricity, Genetics and Radical Islam\nAs of 2016, there is no serious alternative to the liberal package of individualism, human rights,\ndemocracy and a free market. The social protests that swept the Western world in 2011 \u2013 such as\nOccupy Wall Street and the Spanish 15-M movement \u2013 have absolutely nothing against democracy,\nindividualism and human rights, or even against the basic principles of free-market economics. Just\nthe opposite \u2013 they take governments to task for not living up to these liberal ideals. They demand that\nthe market be really free, instead of being controlled and manipulated by corporations and banks \u2018too\nbig to fail\u2019. They call for truly representative democratic institutions, which will serve the interests of\nordinary citizens rather than of moneyed lobbyists and powerful interest groups. Even those blasting\nstock exchanges and parliaments with the harshest criticism don\u2019t have a viable alternative model for\nrunning the world. While it is a favourite pastime of Western academics and activists to find fault\nwith the liberal package, they have so far failed to come up with anything better.\nChina seems to offer a much more serious challenge than Western social protestors. Despite\nliberalising its politics and economics, China is neither a democracy nor a truly free-market economy,\nwhich does not prevent it from becoming the economic giant of the twenty-first century. Yet this\neconomic giant casts a very small ideological shadow. Nobody seems to know what the Chinese\nbelieve these days \u2013 including the Chinese themselves. In theory China is still communist, but in\npractice it is nothing of the kind. Some Chinese thinkers and leaders toy with a return to\nConfucianism, but that\u2019s hardly more than a convenient veneer. This ideological vacuum makes China\nthe most promising breeding ground for the new techno-religions emerging from Silicon Valley\n(which we will discuss in the following chapters). But these techno-religions, with their belief in\nimmortality and virtual paradises, would take at least a decade or two to establish themselves. Hence\nat present, China doesn\u2019t pose a real alternative to liberalism. If bankrupted Greeks despair of the\nliberal model and search for a substitute, \u2018imitating the Chinese\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean much.\nHow about radical Islam, then? Or fundamentalist Christianity, messianic Judaism and revivalist\nHinduism? Whereas the Chinese don\u2019t know what they believe, religious fundamentalists know it only\ntoo well. More than a century after Nietzsche pronounced Him dead, God seems to be making a\ncomeback. But this is a mirage. God is dead \u2013 it just takes a while to get rid of the body. Radical\nIslam poses no serious threat to the liberal package, because for all their fervour, the zealots don\u2019t\nreally understand the world of the twenty-first century, and have nothing relevant to say about the\nnovel dangers and opportunities that new technologies are generating all around us.\nReligion and technology always dance a delicate tango. They push one another, depend on one\nanother and cannot stray too far away from one another. Technology depends on religion, because\nevery invention has many potential applications, and the engineers need some prophet to make the\ncrucial choice and point towards the required destination. Thus in the nineteenth century engineers\ninvented locomotives, radios and internal combustion engines. But as the twentieth century proved,\nyou can use these very same tools to create fascist societies, communist dictatorships and liberal\ndemocracies. Without some religious convictions, the locomotives cannot decide where to go.\nOn the other hand, technology often defines the scope and limits of our religious visions, like a\nwaiter that demarcates our appetites by handing us a menu. New technologies kill old gods and give\nbirth to new gods. That\u2019s why agricultural deities were different from hunter-gatherer spirits, why\nfactory hands fantasise about different paradises than peasants and why the revolutionary technologies\nof the twenty-first century are far more likely to spawn unprecedented religious movements than to\nrevive medieval creeds. Islamic fundamentalists may repeat the mantra that \u2018Islam is the answer\u2019, but\nreligions that lose touch with the technological realities of the day lose their ability even to\nunderstand the questions being asked. What will happen to the job market once artificial intelligence\noutperforms humans in most cognitive tasks? What will be the political impact of a massive new\nclass of economically useless people? What will happen to relationships, families and pension funds\nwhen nanotechnology and regenerative medicine turn eighty into the new fifty? What will happen to\nhuman society when biotechnology enables us to have designer babies, and to open unprecedented\ngaps between rich and poor?\nYou will not find the answers to any of these questions in the Qur\u2019an or sharia law, nor in the Bible\nor in the Confucian Analects, because nobody in the medieval Middle East or in ancient China knew\nmuch about computers, genetics or nanotechnology. Radical Islam may promise an anchor of certainty\nin a world of technological and economic storms \u2013 but in order to navigate a storm, you need a map\nand a rudder rather than just an anchor. Hence radical Islam may appeal to people born and raised in\nits fold, but it has precious little to offer unemployed Spanish youths or anxious Chinese billionaires.\nTrue, hundreds of millions may nevertheless go on believing in Islam, Christianity or Hinduism.\nBut numbers alone don\u2019t count for much in history. History is often shaped by small groups of\nforward-looking innovators rather than by the backward-looking masses. Ten thousand years ago most\npeople were hunter-gatherers and only a few pioneers in the Middle East were farmers. Yet the future\nbelonged to the farmers. In 1850 more than 90 per cent of humans were peasants, and in the small\nvillages along the Ganges, the Nile and the Yangtze nobody knew anything about steam engines,\nrailroads or telegraph lines. Yet the fate of these peasants had already been sealed in Manchester and\nBirmingham by the handful of engineers, politicians and financiers who spearheaded the Industrial\nRevolution. Steam engines, railroads and telegraphs transformed the production of food, textiles,\nvehicles and weapons, giving industrial powers a decisive edge over traditional agricultural\nsocieties.\nEven when the Industrial Revolution spread around the world and penetrated up the Ganges, Nile\nand Yangtze, most people continued to believe in the Vedas, the Bible, the Qur\u2019an and the Analects\nmore than in the steam engine. As today, so too in the nineteenth century there was no shortage of\npriests, mystics and gurus who argued that they alone hold the solution to all of humanity\u2019s woes,\nincluding to the new problems created by the Industrial Revolution. For example, between the 1820s\nand 1880s Egypt (backed by Britain) conquered Sudan, and tried to modernise the country and\nincorporate it into the new international trade network. This destabilised traditional Sudanese society,\ncreating widespread resentment and fostering revolts. In 1881 a local religious leader, Muhammad\nAhmad bin Abdallah, declared that he was the Mahdi (the Messiah), sent to establish the law of God\non earth. His supporters defeated the Anglo-Egyptian army, and beheaded its commander \u2013 General\nCharles Gordon \u2013 in a gesture that shocked Victorian Britain. They then established in Sudan an\nIslamic theocracy governed by sharia law, which lasted until 1898.\nMeanwhile in India, Dayananda Saraswati headed a Hindu revival movement, whose basic\nprinciple was that the Vedic scriptures are never wrong. In 1875 he founded the Arya Samaj (Noble\nSociety), dedicated to the spreading of Vedic knowledge \u2013 though truth be told, Dayananda often\ninterpreted the Vedas in a surprisingly liberal way, supporting for example equal rights for women\nlong before the idea became popular in the West.\nDayananda\u2019s contemporary, Pope Pius IX, had much more conservative views about women, but\nshared Dayananda\u2019s admiration for superhuman authority. Pius led a series of reforms in Catholic\ndogma, and established the novel principle of papal infallibility, according to which the Pope can\nnever err in matters of faith (this seemingly medieval idea became binding Catholic dogma only in\n1870, eleven years after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species).\nThirty years before the Pope discovered that he is incapable of making mistakes, a failed Chinese\nscholar called Hong Xiuquan had a succession of religious visions. In these visions, God revealed\nthat Hong was none other than the younger brother of Jesus Christ. God then invested Hong with a\ndivine mission. He told Hong to expel the Manchu \u2018demons\u2019 that had ruled China since the\nseventeenth century, and establish on earth the Great Peaceful Kingdom of Heaven (Taiping Ti\u0101ngu\u00f3).\nHong\u2019s message fired the imagination of millions of desperate Chinese, who were shaken by China\u2019s\ndefeats in the Opium Wars and by the coming of modern industry and European imperialism. But\nHong did not lead them to a kingdom of peace. Rather, he led them against the Manchu Qing dynasty\nin the Taiping Rebellion \u2013 the deadliest war of the nineteenth century. From 1850 to 1864, at least 20\nmillion people lost their lives; far more than in the Napoleonic Wars or in the American Civil War.\nHundreds of millions clung to the religious dogmas of Hong, Dayananda, Pius and the Mahdi even\nas industrial factories, railroads and steamships filled the world. Yet most of us don\u2019t think about the\nnineteenth century as the age of faith. When we think of nineteenth-century visionaries, we are far\nmore likely to recall Marx, Engels and Lenin than the Mahdi, Pius IX or Hong Xiuquan. And rightly\nso. Though in 1850 socialism was only a fringe movement, it soon gathered momentum, and changed\nthe world in far more profound ways than the self-proclaimed messiahs of China and Sudan. If you\ncount on national health services, pension funds and free schools, you need to thank Marx and Lenin\n(and Otto von Bismarck) far more than Hong Xiuquan or the Mahdi.\nWhy did Marx and Lenin succeed where Hong and the Mahdi failed? Not because socialist\nhumanism was philosophically more sophisticated than Islamic and Christian theology, but rather\nbecause Marx and Lenin devoted more attention to understanding the technological and economic\nrealities of their time than to perusing ancient texts and prophetic dreams. Steam engines, railroads,\ntelegraphs and electricity created unheard-of problems as well as unprecedented opportunities. The\nexperiences, needs and hopes of the new class of urban proletariats were simply too different from\nthose of biblical peasants. To answer these needs and hopes, Marx and Lenin studied how a steam\nengine functions, how a coal mine operates, how railroads shape the economy and how electricity\ninfluences politics.\nLenin was once asked to define communism in a single sentence. \u2018Communism is power to worker\ncouncils,\u2019 he said, \u2018plus electrification of the whole country.\u2019 There can be no communism without\nelectricity, without railroads, without radio. You couldn\u2019t establish a communist regime in sixteenthcentury Russia, because communism necessitates the concentration of information and resources in\none hub. \u2018From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\u2019 only works when\nproduce can easily be collected and distributed across vast distances, and when activities can be\nmonitored and coordinated over entire countries.\nMarx and his followers understood the new technological realities and the new human experiences,\nso they had relevant answers to the new problems of industrial society, as well as original ideas\nabout how to benefit from the unprecedented opportunities. The socialists created a brave new\nreligion for a brave new world. They promised salvation through technology and economics, thus\nestablishing the first techno-religion in history, and changing the foundations of ideological discourse.\nBefore Marx, people defined and divided themselves according to their views about God, not about\nproduction methods. Since Marx, questions of technology and economic structure became far more\nimportant and divisive than debates about the soul and the afterlife. In the second half of the twentieth\ncentury, humankind almost obliterated itself in an argument about production methods. Even the\nharshest critics of Marx and Lenin adopted their basic attitude towards history and society, and began\nthinking about technology and production much more carefully than about God and heaven.\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, few people were as perceptive as Marx, hence only a few countries\nunderwent rapid industrialisation. These few countries conquered the world. Most societies failed to\nunderstand what was happening, and they therefore missed the train of progress. Dayananda\u2019s India\nand the Mahdi\u2019s Sudan remained far more preoccupied with God than with steam engines, hence they\nwere occupied and exploited by industrial Britain. Only in the last few years has India managed to\nmake significant progress in closing the economic and geopolitical gap separating it from Britain.\nSudan is still struggling far behind.\nIn the early twenty-first century the train of progress is again pulling out of the station \u2013 and this will\nprobably be the last train ever to leave the station called Homo sapiens. Those who miss this train\nwill never get a second chance. In order to get a seat on it, you need to understand twenty-firstcentury technology, and in particular the powers of biotechnology and computer algorithms. These\npowers are far more potent than steam and the telegraph, and they will not be used merely for the\nproduction of food, textiles, vehicles and weapons. The main products of the twenty-first century will\nbe bodies, brains and minds, and the gap between those who know how to engineer bodies and brains\nand those who do not will be far bigger than the gap between Dickens\u2019s Britain and the Mahdi\u2019s\nSudan. Indeed, it will be bigger than the gap between Sapiens and Neanderthals. In the twenty-first\ncentury, those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities of creation and destruction,\nwhile those left behind will face extinction.\nSocialism, which was very up to date a hundred years ago, failed to keep up with the new\ntechnology. Leonid Brezhnev and Fidel Castro held on to ideas that Marx and Lenin formulated in the\nage of steam, and did not understand the power of computers and biotechnology. Liberals, in contrast,\nadapted far better to the information age. This partly explains why Khrushchev\u2019s 1956 prediction\nnever materialised, and why it was the liberal capitalists who eventually buried the Marxists. If Marx\ncame back to life today, he would probably urge his few remaining disciples to devote less time to\nreading Das Kapital and more time to studying the Internet and the human genome.\nRadical Islam is in a far worse position than socialism. It has not yet even come to terms with the\nIndustrial Revolution \u2013 no wonder it has little of relevance to say about genetic engineering and\nartificial intelligence. Islam, Christianity and other traditional religions are still important players in\nthe world. Yet their role is now largely reactive. In the past, they were a creative force. Christianity,\nfor example, spread the hitherto heretical idea that all humans are equal before God, thereby changing\nhuman political structures, social hierarchies and even gender relations. In his Sermon on the Mount,\nJesus went further, insisting that the meek and oppressed are God\u2019s favourite people, thus turning the\npyramid of power on its head, and providing ammunition for generations of revolutionaries.\nIn addition to social and ethical reforms, Christianity was responsible for important economic and\ntechnological innovations. The Catholic Church established medieval Europe\u2019s most sophisticated\nadministrative system, and pioneered the use of archives, catalogues, timetables and other techniques\nof data processing. The Vatican was the closest thing twelfth-century Europe had to Silicon Valley.\nThe Church established Europe\u2019s first economic corporations \u2013 the monasteries \u2013 which for 1,000\nyears spearheaded the European economy and introduced advanced agricultural and administrative\nmethods. Monasteries were the first institutions to use clocks, and for centuries they and the cathedral\nschools were the most important learning centres of Europe, helping to found many of Europe\u2019s first\nuniversities, such as Bologna, Oxford and Salamanca.\nToday the Catholic Church continues to enjoy the loyalties and tithes of hundreds of millions of\nfollowers. Yet it and the other theist religions have long since turned from a creative into a reactive\nforce. They are busy with rearguard holding operations more than with pioneering novel technologies,\ninnovative economic methods or groundbreaking social ideas. They now mostly agonise over the\ntechnologies, methods and ideas propagated by other movements. Biologists invent the contraceptive\npill \u2013 and the Pope doesn\u2019t know what to do about it. Computer scientists develop the Internet \u2013 and\nrabbis argue whether orthodox Jews should be allowed to surf it. Feminist thinkers call upon women\nto take possession of their bodies \u2013 and learned muftis debate how to confront such incendiary ideas.\nAsk yourself: what was the most influential discovery, invention or creation of the twentieth\ncentury? That\u2019s a difficult question, because it is hard to choose from a long list of candidates,\nincluding scientific discoveries such as antibiotics, technological inventions such as computers, and\nideological creations such as feminism. Now ask yourself: what was the most influential discovery,\ninvention or creation of traditional religions such as Islam and Christianity in the twentieth century?\nThis too is a very difficult question, because there is so little to choose from. What did priests, rabbis\nand muftis discover in the twentieth century that can be mentioned in the same breath as antibiotics,\ncomputers or feminism? Having mulled over these two questions, from where do you think the big\nchanges of the twenty-first century will emerge: from the Islamic State, or from Google? Yes, the\nIslamic State knows how to put videos on YouTube; but leaving aside the industry of torture, how\nmany new start-ups have emerged from Syria or Iraq lately?\nBillions of people, including many scientists, continue to use religious scriptures as a source of\nauthority, but these texts are no longer a source of creativity. Think, for example, about the acceptance\nof gay marriage or female clergy by the more progressive branches of Christianity. Where did this\nacceptance originate? Not from reading the Bible, St Augustine or Martin Luther. Rather, it came from\nreading texts like Michel Foucault\u2019s The History of Sexuality or Donna Haraway\u2019s \u2018A Cyborg\nManifesto\u2019.\n14 Yet Christian true-believers \u2013 however progressive \u2013 cannot admit to drawing their\nethics from Foucault and Haraway. So they go back to the Bible, to St Augustine and to Martin Luther,\nand make a very thorough search. They read page after page and story after story with the utmost\nattention, until they find what they need: some maxim, parable or ruling that if interpreted creatively\nenough means that God blesses gay marriages and that women can be ordained to the priesthood.\nThey then pretend the idea originated in the Bible, when in fact it originated with Foucault. The Bible\nis kept as a source of authority, even though it is no longer a true source of inspiration.\nThat\u2019s why traditional religions offer no real alternative to liberalism. Their scriptures don\u2019t have\nanything to say about genetic engineering or artificial intelligence, and most priests, rabbis and muftis\ndon\u2019t understand the latest breakthroughs in biology and computer science. For if you want to\nunderstand these breakthroughs, you don\u2019t have much choice \u2013 you need to spend time reading\nscientific articles and conducting lab experiments instead of memorising and debating ancient texts.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean liberalism can rest on its laurels. True, it has won the humanist wars of religion,\nand as of 2016 it has no viable alternative. But its very success may contain the seeds of its ruin. The\ntriumphant liberal ideals are now pushing humankind to reach for immortality, bliss and divinity.\nEgged on by the allegedly infallible wishes of customers and voters, scientists and engineers devote\nmore and more energies to these liberal projects. Yet what the scientists are discovering and what the\nengineers are developing may unwittingly expose both the inherent flaws in the liberal world view\nand the blindness of customers and voters. When genetic engineering and artificial intelligence reveal\ntheir full potential, liberalism, democracy and free markets might become as obsolete as flint knives,\ntape cassettes, Islam and communism.\nThis book began by forecasting that in the twenty-first century, humans will try to attain\nimmortality, bliss and divinity. This forecast isn\u2019t very original or far-sighted. It simply reflects the\ntraditional ideals of liberal humanism. Since humanism has long sanctified the life, the emotions and\nthe desires of human beings, it\u2019s hardly surprising that a humanist civilisation will want to maximise\nhuman lifespans, human happiness and human power. Yet the third and final part of the book will\nargue that attempting to realise this humanist dream will undermine its very foundations, by\nunleashing new post-humanist technologies. The humanist belief in feelings has enabled us to benefit\nfrom the fruits of the modern covenant without paying its price. We don\u2019t need any gods to limit our\npower and give us meaning \u2013 the free choices of customers and voters supply us with all the meaning\nwe require. What, then, will happen once we realise that customers and voters never make free\nchoices, and once we have the technology to calculate, design or outsmart their feelings? If the whole\nuniverse is pegged to the human experience, what will happen once the human experience becomes\njust another designable product, no different in essence from any other item in the supermarket?\nBrains as computers \u2013 computers as brains. Artificial intelligence is now poised to surpass human intelligence.\n\u00a9 VLADGRIN/Shutterstock.com.\nPART III\nHomo Sapiens Loses Control\nCan humans go on running the world and giving it meaning?\nHow do biotechnology and artificial intelligence threaten humanism?\nWho might inherit humankind, and what new religion might replace humanism?\n8\nThe Time Bomb in the Laboratory\nIn 2016 the world is dominated by the liberal package of individualism, human rights, democracy and\nthe free market. Yet twenty-first-century science is undermining the foundations of the liberal order.\nBecause science does not deal with questions of value, it cannot determine whether liberals are right\nin valuing liberty more than equality, or in valuing the individual more than the collective. However,\nlike every other religion, liberalism too is based on what it believes to be factual statements, in\naddition to abstract ethical judgements. And these factual statements just don\u2019t stand up to rigorous\nscientific scrutiny.\nLiberals value individual liberty so much because they believe that humans have free will.\nAccording to liberalism, the decisions of voters and customers are neither deterministic nor random.\nPeople are of course influenced by external forces and chance events, but at the end of the day each of\nus can wave the magic wand of freedom and decide things for ourselves. This is the reason liberalism\ngives so much importance to voters and customers, and instructs us to follow our heart and do what\nfeels good. It is our free will that imbues the universe with meaning, and since no outsider can know\nhow you really feel or predict your choices for sure, you shouldn\u2019t trust any Big Brother to look after\nyour interests and desires.\nAttributing free will to humans is not an ethical judgement \u2013 it purports to be a factual description\nof the world. Although this so-called factual description might have made sense back in the days of\nLocke, Rousseau and Thomas Jefferson, it does not sit well with the latest findings of the life\nsciences. The contradiction between free will and contemporary science is the elephant in the\nlaboratory, whom many prefer not to see as they peer into their microscopes and fMRI scanners.\n1\nIn the eighteenth century Homo sapiens was like a mysterious black box, whose inner workings\nwere beyond our grasp. Hence when scholars asked why a man drew a knife and stabbed another to\ndeath, an acceptable answer said: \u2018Because he chose to. He used his free will to choose murder,\nwhich is why he is fully responsible for his crime.\u2019 Over the last century, as scientists opened up the\nSapiens black box, they discovered there neither soul, nor free will, nor \u2018self\u2019 \u2013 but only genes,\nhormones and neurons that obey the same physical and chemical laws governing the rest of reality.\nToday, when scholars ask why a man drew a knife and stabbed someone death, answering \u2018Because\nhe chose to\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut the mustard. Instead, geneticists and brain scientists provide a much more\ndetailed answer: \u2018He did it due to such-and-such electrochemical processes in the brain, which were\nshaped by a particular genetic make-up, which reflect ancient evolutionary pressures coupled with\nchance mutations.\u2019\nThe electrochemical brain processes that result in murder are either deterministic or random or a\ncombination of both \u2013 but they are never free. For example, when a neuron fires an electric charge,\nthis may either be a deterministic reaction to external stimuli, or it might be the outcome of a random\nevent such as the spontaneous decomposition of a radioactive atom. Neither option leaves any room\nfor free will. Decisions reached through a chain reaction of biochemical events, each determined by a\nprevious event, are certainly not free. Decisions resulting from random subatomic accidents aren\u2019t\nfree either. They are just random. And when random accidents combine with deterministic processes,\nwe get probabilistic outcomes, but this too doesn\u2019t amount to freedom.\nSuppose we build a robot whose central processing unit is linked to a radioactive lump of uranium.\nWhen choosing between two options \u2013 say, press the right button or the left button \u2013 the robot counts\nthe number of uranium atoms that decayed during the previous minute. If the number is even \u2013 it\npresses the right button. If the number is odd \u2013 the left button. We can never be certain about the\nactions of such a robot. But nobody would call this contraption \u2018free\u2019, and we wouldn\u2019t dream of\nallowing it to vote in democratic elections or holding it legally responsible for its actions.\nTo the best of our scientific understanding, determinism and randomness have divided the entire\ncake between them, leaving not even a crumb for \u2018freedom\u2019. The sacred word \u2018freedom\u2019 turns out to\nbe, just like \u2018soul\u2019, an empty term that carries no discernible meaning. Free will exists only in the\nimaginary stories we humans have invented.\nThe last nail in freedom\u2019s coffin is provided by the theory of evolution. Just as evolution cannot be\nsquared with eternal souls, neither can it swallow the idea of free will. For if humans are free, how\ncould natural selection have shaped them? According to the theory of evolution, all the choices\nanimals make \u2013 whether of residence, food or mates \u2013 reflect their genetic code. If, thanks to its fit\ngenes, an animal chooses to eat a nutritious mushroom and copulate with healthy and fertile mates,\nthese genes pass on to the next generation. If, because of unfit genes, an animal chooses poisonous\nmushrooms and anaemic mates, these genes become extinct. However, if an animal \u2018freely\u2019 chooses\nwhat to eat and with whom to mate, then natural selection is left with nothing to work on.\nWhen confronted with such scientific explanations, people often brush them aside, pointing out that\nthey feel free, and that they act according to their own wishes and decisions. This is true. Humans act\naccording to their desires. If by \u2018free will\u2019 you mean the ability to act according to your desires \u2013 then\nyes, humans have free will, and so do chimpanzees, dogs and parrots. When Polly wants a cracker,\nPolly eats a cracker. But the million-dollar question is not whether parrots and humans can act out\ntheir inner desires \u2013 the question is whether they can choose their desires in the first place. Why\ndoes Polly want a cracker rather than a cucumber? Why do I decide to kill my annoying neighbour\ninstead of turning the other cheek? Why do I want to buy the red car rather than the black? Why do I\nprefer voting for the Conservatives rather than the Labour Party? I don\u2019t choose any of these wishes. I\nfeel a particular wish welling up within me because this is the feeling created by the biochemical\nprocesses in my brain. These processes might be deterministic or random, but not free.\nYou might reply that at least in the case of major decisions such as murdering a neighbour or\nelecting a government, my choice does not reflect a momentary feeling, but a long and reasoned\ncontemplation of weighty arguments. However, there are many possible trains of arguments I could\nfollow, some of which will cause me to vote Conservative, others to vote Labour, and still others to\nvote UKIP or just stay at home. What makes me board one train of reasoning rather than another? In\nthe Paddington of my brain, I may be compelled to get on a particular train of reasoning by\ndeterministic processes, or I may embark at random. But I don\u2019t \u2018freely\u2019 choose to think those thoughts\nthat will make me vote Conservative.\nThese are not just hypotheses or philosophical speculations. Today we can use brain scanners to\npredict people\u2019s desires and decisions well before they are aware of them. In one kind of experiment,\npeople are placed within a huge brain scanner, holding a switch in each hand. They are asked to press\none of the two switches whenever they feel like it. Scientists observing neural activity in the brain\ncan predict which switch the person will press well before the person actually does so, and even\nbefore the person is aware of their own intention. Neural events in the brain indicating the person\u2019s\ndecision begin from a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds before the person is aware of this\nchoice.\n2\nThe decision to press either the right or left switch certainly reflected the person\u2019s choice. Yet it\nwasn\u2019t a free choice. In fact, our belief in free will results from faulty logic. When a biochemical\nchain reaction makes me desire to press the right switch, I feel that I really want to press the right\nswitch. And this is true. I really want to press it. Yet people erroneously jump to the conclusion that if\nI want to press it, I choose to want to. This is of course false. I don\u2019t choose my desires. I only feel\nthem, and act accordingly.\nPeople nevertheless go on arguing about free will because even scientists all too often continue to\nuse outdated theological concepts. Christian, Muslim and Jewish theologians debated for centuries\nthe relations between the soul and the will. They assumed that every human has an internal inner\nessence \u2013 called the soul \u2013 which is my true self. They further maintained that this self possesses\nvarious desires, just as it possesses clothes, vehicles and houses. I allegedly choose my desires in the\nsame way I choose my clothes, and my fate is determined according to these choices. If I choose good\ndesires, I go to heaven. If I choose bad desires, I am sent to hell. The question then arose, how exactly\ndo I choose my desires? Why, for example, did Eve desire to eat the forbidden fruit the snake offered\nher? Was this desire forced upon her? Did this desire just pop up within her by pure chance? Or did\nshe choose it \u2018freely\u2019? If she didn\u2019t choose it freely, why punish her for it?\nHowever, once we accept that there is no soul, and that humans have no inner essence called \u2018the\nself\u2019, it no longer makes sense to ask, \u2018How does the self choose its desires?\u2019 It\u2019s like asking a\nbachelor, \u2018How does your wife choose her clothes?\u2019 In reality, there is only a stream of\nconsciousness, and desires arise and pass within this stream, but there is no permanent self who owns\nthe desires, hence it is meaningless to ask whether I choose my desires deterministically, randomly or\nfreely.\nIt may sound extremely complicated, but it is surprisingly easy to test this idea. Next time a thought\npops up in your mind, stop and ask yourself: \u2018Why did I think this particular thought? Did I decide a\nminute ago to think this thought, and only then did I think it? Or did it just arise in my mind, without\nmy permission or instruction? If I am indeed the master of my thoughts and decisions, can I decide not\nto think about anything at all for the next sixty seconds?\u2019Just try, and see what happens.\nDoubting free will is not just a philosophical exercise. It has practical implications. If organisms\nindeed lack free will, it implies we could manipulate and even control their desires using drugs,\ngenetic engineering or direct brain stimulation.\nIf you want to see philosophy in action, pay a visit to a robo-rat laboratory. A robo-rat is a run-ofthe-mill rat with a twist: scientists have implanted electrodes into the sensory and reward areas in the\nrat\u2019s brain. This enables the scientists to manoeuvre the rat by remote control. After short training\nsessions, researchers have managed not only to make the rats turn left or right, but also to climb\nladders, sniff around garbage piles, and do things that rats normally dislike, such as jumping from\ngreat heights. Armies and corporations show keen interest in the robo-rats, hoping they could prove\nuseful in many tasks and situations. For example, robo-rats could help detect survivors trapped under\ncollapsed buildings, locate bombs and booby traps, and map underground tunnels and caves.\nAnimal-welfare activists have voiced concern about the suffering such experiments inflict on the\nrats. Professor Sanjiv Talwar of the State University of New York, one of the leading robo-rat\nresearchers, has dismissed these concerns, arguing that the rats actually enjoy the experiments. After\nall, explains Talwar, the rats \u2018work for pleasure\u2019 and when the electrodes stimulate the reward centre\nin their brain, \u2018the rat feels Nirvana\u2019.\n3\nTo the best of our understanding, the rat doesn\u2019t feel that somebody else controls her, and she\ndoesn\u2019t feel that she is being coerced to do something against her will. When Professor Talwar\npresses the remote control, the rat wants to move to the left, which is why she moves to the left. When\nthe professor presses another switch, the rat wants to climb a ladder, which is why she climbs the\nladder. After all, the rat\u2019s desires are nothing but a pattern of firing neurons. What does it matter\nwhether the neurons are firing because they are stimulated by other neurons, or because they are\nstimulated by transplanted electrodes connected to Professor Talwar\u2019s remote control? If you asked\nthe rat about it, she might well have told you, \u2018Sure I have free will! Look, I want to turn left \u2013 and I\nturn left. I want to climb a ladder \u2013 and I climb a ladder. Doesn\u2019t that prove that I have free will?\u2019\nExperiments performed on Homo sapiens indicate that like rats humans too can be manipulated,\nand that it is possible to create or annihilate even complex feelings such as love, anger, fear and\ndepression by stimulating the right spots in the human brain. The US military has recently initiated\nexperiments on implanting computer chips in people\u2019s brains, hoping to use this method to treat\nsoldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n4\nIn Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, doctors\nhave pioneered a novel treatment for patients suffering from acute depression. They implant\nelectrodes into the patient\u2019s brain, and wire the electrodes to a minuscule computer implanted into the\npatient\u2019s breast. On receiving a command from the computer, the electrodes use weak electric\ncurrents to paralyse the brain area responsible for the depression. The treatment does not always\nsucceed, but in some cases patients reported that the feeling of dark emptiness that tormented them\nthroughout their lives disappeared as if by magic.\nOne patient complained that several months after the operation, he had a relapse, and was\novercome by severe depression. Upon inspection, the doctors found the source of the problem: the\ncomputer\u2019s battery had run out of power. Once they changed the battery, the depression quickly melted\naway.\n5\nDue to obvious ethical restrictions, researchers implant electrodes into human brains only under\nspecial circumstances. Hence most relevant experiments on humans are conducted using non-intrusive\nhelmet-like devices (technically known as \u2018transcranial direct current stimulators\u2019). The helmet is\nfitted with electrodes that attach to the scalp from outside. It produces weak electromagnetic fields\nand directs them towards specific brain areas, thereby stimulating or inhibiting select brain activities.\nThe American military experiments with such helmets in the hope of sharpening the focus and\nenhancing the performance of soldiers both in training sessions and on the battlefield. The main\nexperiments are conducted in the Human Effectiveness Directorate, which is located in an Ohio air\nforce base. Though the results are far from conclusive, and though the hype around transcranial\nstimulators currently runs far ahead of actual achievements, several studies have indicated that the\nmethod may indeed enhance the cognitive abilities of drone operators, air-traffic controllers, snipers\nand other personnel whose duties require them to remain highly attentive for extended periods.\n6\nSally Adee, a journalist for the New Scientist, was allowed to visit a training facility for snipers\nand test the effects herself. At first, she entered a battlefield simulator without wearing the\ntranscranial helmet. Sally describes how fear swept over her as she saw twenty masked men,\nstrapped with suicide bombs and armed with rifles, charge straight towards her. \u2018For every one I\nmanage to shoot dead,\u2019 writes Sally, \u2018three new assailants pop up from nowhere. I\u2019m clearly not\nshooting fast enough, and panic and incompetence are making me continually jam my rifle.\u2019 Luckily\nfor her, the assailants were just video images, projected on huge screens all around her. Still, she was\nso disappointed with her poor performance that she felt like putting down the rifle and leaving the\nsimulator.\nThen they wired her up to the helmet. She reports feeling nothing unusual, except a slight tingle and\na strange metallic taste in her mouth. Yet she began picking off the terrorists one by one, as coolly and\nmethodically as if she were Rambo or Clint Eastwood. \u2018As twenty of them run at me brandishing their\nguns, I calmly line up my rifle, take a moment to breathe deeply, and pick off the closest one, before\ntranquilly assessing my next target. In what seems like next to no time, I hear a voice call out, \u201cOkay,\nthat\u2019s it.\u201d The lights come up in the simulation room . . . In the sudden quiet amid the bodies around\nme, I was really expecting more assailants, and I\u2019m a bit disappointed when the team begins to\nremove my electrodes. I look up and wonder if someone wound the clocks forward. Inexplicably,\ntwenty minutes have just passed. \u201cHow many did I get?\u201d I ask the assistant. She looks at me\nquizzically. \u201cAll of them.\u201d\u2019\nThe experiment changed Sally\u2019s life. In the following days she realised she has been through a\n\u2018near-spiritual experience . . . what defined the experience was not feeling smarter or learning faster:\nthe thing that made the earth drop out from under my feet was that for the first time in my life,\neverything in my head finally shut up . . . My brain without self-doubt was a revelation. There was\nsuddenly this incredible silence in my head . . . I hope you can sympathise with me when I tell you\nthat the thing I wanted most acutely for the weeks following my experience was to go back and strap\non those electrodes. I also started to have a lot of questions. Who was I apart from the angry bitter\ngnomes that populate my mind and drive me to failure because I\u2019m too scared to try? And where did\nthose voices come from?\u2019\n7\nSome of those voices repeat society\u2019s prejudices, some echo our personal history, and some\narticulate our genetic legacy. All of them together, says Sally, create an invisible story that shapes our\nconscious decisions in ways we seldom grasp. What would happen if we could rewrite our inner\nmonologues, or even silence them completely on occasion?\n8\nAs of 2016, transcranial stimulators are still in their infancy, and it is unclear if and when they will\nbecome a mature technology. So far they provide enhanced capabilities for only short durations, and\neven Sally Adee\u2019s twenty-minute experience may be quite exceptional (or perhaps even the outcome\nof the notorious placebo effect). Most published studies of transcranial stimulators are based on very\nsmall samples of people operating under special circumstances, and the long-term effects and hazards\nare completely unknown. However, if the technology does mature, or if some other method is found to\nmanipulate the brain\u2019s electric patterns, what would it do to human societies and to human beings?\nPeople may well manipulate their brain\u2019s electric circuits not just in order to shoot terrorists, but\nalso to achieve more mundane liberal goals. Namely, to study and work more efficiently, immerse\nourselves in games and hobbies, and be able to focus on what interests us at any particular moment,\nbe it maths or football. However, if and when such manipulations become routine, the supposedly free\nwill of customers will become just another product we can buy. You want to master the piano but\nwhenever practice time comes you actually prefer to watch television? No problem: just put on the\nhelmet, install the right software, and you will be downright aching to play the piano.\nYou may counter-argue that the ability to silence or enhance the voices in your head will actually\nstrengthen rather than undermine your free will. Presently, you often fail to realise your most\ncherished and authentic desires due to external distractions. With the help of the attention helmet and\nsimilar devices, you could more easily silence the alien voices of priests, spin doctors, advertisers\nand neighbours, and focus on what you want. However, as we will shortly see, the notion that you\nhave a single self and that you could therefore distinguish your authentic desires from alien voices is\njust another liberal myth, debunked by the latest scientific research.\nWho Are I?\nScience undermines not only the liberal belief in free will, but also the belief in individualism.\nLiberals believe that we have a single and indivisible self. To be an individual means that I am individual. Yes, my body is made up of approximately 37 trillion cells,\n9 and each day both my body and\nmy mind go through countless permutations and transformations. Yet if I really pay attention and strive\nto get in touch with myself, I am bound to discover deep inside a single clear and authentic voice,\nwhich is my true self, and which is the source of all meaning and authority in the universe. For\nliberalism to make sense, I must have one \u2013 and only one \u2013 true self, for if I had more than one\nauthentic voice, how would I know which voice to heed in the polling station, in the supermarket and\nin the marriage market?\nHowever, over the last few decades the life sciences have reached the conclusion that this liberal\nstory is pure mythology. The single authentic self is as real as the eternal Christian soul, Santa Claus\nand the Easter Bunny. If you look really deep within yourself, the seeming unity that we take for\ngranted dissolves into a cacophony of conflicting voices, none of which is \u2018my true self\u2019. Humans\naren\u2019t individuals. They are \u2018dividuals\u2019.\nThe human brain is composed of two hemispheres, connected to each other through a thick neural\ncable. Each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body. The right hemisphere controls the left\nside of the body, receives data from the left-hand field of vision and is responsible for moving the left\narm and leg, and vice versa. This is why people who have had a stroke in their right hemisphere\nsometimes ignore the left side of their body (combing only the right side of their hair, or eating only\nthe food placed on the right side of their plate).\n10\nThere are also emotional and cognitive differences between the two hemispheres, though the\ndivision is far from clear-cut. Most cognitive activities involve both hemispheres, but not to the same\ndegree. For example, in most cases the left hemisphere plays a more important role in speech and in\nlogical reasoning, whereas the right hemisphere is more dominant in processing spatial information.\nMany breakthroughs in understanding the relations between the two hemispheres were based on the\nstudy of epilepsy patients. In severe cases of epilepsy, electrical storms begin in one part of the brain\nbut quickly spread to other parts, causing a very acute seizure. During such seizures patients lose\ncontrol of their body, and frequent seizures consequently prevent patients from holding a job or\nleading a normal lifestyle. In the mid-twentieth century, when all other treatments failed, doctors\nalleviated the problem by cutting the thick neural cable connecting the two hemispheres, so that\nelectrical storms beginning in one hemisphere could not spill over to the other. For brain scientists\nthese patients were a gold-mine of astounding data.\nSome of the most notable studies on these split-brain patients were conducted by Professor Roger\nWolcott Sperry, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his groundbreaking\ndiscoveries, and by his student, Professor Michael S. Gazzaniga. One study was conducted on a\nteenaged boy. The boy was asked what he would like to do when he grew up. The boy answered that\nhe wanted to be a draughtsman. This answer was provided by the left hemisphere, which plays a\ncrucial part in logical reasoning as well as in speech. Yet the boy had another active speech centre in\nhis right hemisphere, which could not control vocal language, but could spell words using Scrabble\ntiles. The researchers were keen to know what the right hemisphere would say. So they spread\nScrabble tiles on the table, and then took a piece of paper and wrote on it: \u2018What would you like to\ndo when you grow up?\u2019 They placed the paper at the edge of the boy\u2019s left visual field. Data from the\nleft visual field is processed in the right hemisphere. Since the right hemisphere could not use vocal\nlanguage, the boy said nothing. But his left hand began moving rapidly across the table, collecting\ntiles from here and there. It spelled out: \u2018automobile race\u2019. Spooky.\n11\nEqually eerie behaviour was displayed by patient WJ, a Second World War veteran. WJ\u2019s hands\nwere each controlled by a different hemisphere. Since the two hemispheres were out of touch with\none another, it sometimes happened that his right hand would reach out to open a door, and then his\nleft hand would intervene and try to slam the door shut.\nIn another experiment, Gazzaniga and his team flashed a picture of a chicken claw to the left-half\nbrain \u2013 the side responsible for speech \u2013 and simultaneously flashed a picture of a snowy landscape\nto the right brain. When asked what they saw, patients invariably answered \u2018a chicken claw\u2019.\nGazzaniga then presented one patient, PS, with a series of picture cards and asked him to point to the\none that best matched what he had seen. The patient\u2019s right hand (controlled by his left brain) pointed\nto a picture of a chicken, but simultaneously his left hand shot out and pointed to a snow shovel.\nGazzaniga then asked PS the million-dollar question: \u2018Why did you point both to the chicken and to\nthe shovel?\u2019 PS replied, \u2018Oh, the chicken claw goes with the chicken, and you need a shovel to clean\nout the chicken shed.\u2019\n12\nWhat happened here? The left brain, which controls speech, had no data about the snow scene, and\ntherefore did not really know why the left hand pointed to the shovel. So it just invented something\ncredible. After repeating this experiment many times, Gazzaniga concluded that the left hemisphere of\nthe brain is the seat not only of our verbal abilities, but also of an internal interpreter that constantly\ntries to make sense of our life, using partial clues in order to concoct plausible stories.\nIn another experiment, the non-verbal right hemisphere was shown a pornographic image. The\npatient reacted by blushing and giggling. \u2018What did you see?\u2019 asked the mischievous researchers.\n\u2018Nothing, just a flash of light,\u2019 said the left hemisphere, and the patient immediately giggled again,\ncovering her mouth with her hand. \u2018Why are you laughing then?\u2019 they insisted. The bewildered lefthemisphere interpreter \u2013 struggling for some rational explanation \u2013 replied that one of the machines in\nthe room looked very funny.\n13\nIt\u2019s as if the CIA conducts a drone strike in Pakistan, unbeknown to the US State Department. When\na journalist grills State Department officials about it, they make up some plausible explanation. In\nreality, the spin doctors don\u2019t have a clue why the strike was ordered, so they just invent something. A\nsimilar mechanism is employed by all human beings, not just by split-brain patients. Again and again\nmy own private CIA does things without the approval or knowledge of my State Department, and then\nmy State Department cooks up a story that presents me in the best possible light. Often enough, the\nState Department itself becomes convinced of the pure fantasies it has invented.\n14\nSimilar conclusions have been reached by behavioural economists, who want to know how people\ntake economic decisions. Or more accurately, who takes these decisions. Who decides to buy a\nToyota rather than a Mercedes, to go on holiday to Paris rather than Thailand, and to invest in South\nKorean treasury bonds rather than in the Shanghai stock exchange? Most experiments have indicated\nthat there is no single self making any of these decisions. Rather, they result from a tug of war\nbetween different and often conflicting inner entities.\nOne groundbreaking experiment was conducted by Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize in\nEconomics. Kahneman asked a group of volunteers to join a three-part experiment. In the \u2018short\u2019 part\nof the experiment, the volunteers inserted one hand into a container filled with water at 14\u00b0C for one\nminute, which is unpleasant, bordering on painful. After sixty seconds, they were told to take their\nhand out. In the \u2018long\u2019 part of the experiment, volunteers placed their other hand in another water\ncontainer. The temperature there was also 14\u00b0C, but after sixty seconds, hot water was secretly added\ninto the container, bringing the temperature up to 15\u00b0C. Thirty seconds later, they were told to pull out\ntheir hand. Some volunteers did the \u2018short\u2019 part first, while others began with the \u2018long\u2019 part. In either\ncase, exactly seven minutes after both parts were over came the third and most important part of the\nexperiment. The volunteers were told they must repeat one of the two parts, and it was up to them to\nchoose which; 80 per cent preferred to repeat the \u2018long\u2019 experiment, remembering it as less painful.\nThe cold-water experiment is so simple, yet its implications shake the core of the liberal world\nview. It exposes the existence of at least two different selves within us: the experiencing self and the\nnarrating self. The experiencing self is our moment-to-moment consciousness. For the experiencing\nself, it\u2019s obvious that the \u2018long\u2019 part of the cold-water experiment was worse. First you experience\nwater at 14\u00b0C for sixty seconds, which is every bit as bad as what you experience in the \u2018short\u2019 part,\nand then you must endure another thirty seconds of water at 15\u00b0C, which is not quite as bad, but still\nfar from pleasant. For the experiencing self, it is impossible that adding a slightly unpleasant\nexperience to a very unpleasant experience will make the entire episode more appealing.\nHowever, the experiencing self remembers nothing. It tells no stories, and is seldom consulted\nwhen it comes to big decisions. Retrieving memories, telling stories and making big decisions are all\nthe monopoly of a very different entity inside us: the narrating self. The narrating self is akin to\nGazzaniga\u2019s left-brain interpreter. It is forever busy spinning yarns about the past and making plans\nfor the future. Like every journalist, poet and politician, the narrating self takes many short cuts. It\ndoesn\u2019t narrate everything, and usually weaves the story only from peak moments and end results. The\nvalue of the whole experience is determined by averaging peaks with ends. For example, in the short\npart of the cold-water experiment, the narrating self finds the average between the worst part (the\nwater was very cold) and the last moment (the water was still very cold) and concludes that \u2018the\nwater was very cold\u2019. The narrating self does the same thing with the long part of the experiment. It\nfinds the average between the worst part (the water was very cold) and the last moment (the water\nwas not so cold) and concludes that \u2018the water was somewhat warmer\u2019. Crucially, the narrating self\nis duration-blind, giving no importance to the differing lengths of the two parts. So when it has a\nchoice between the two, it prefers to repeat the long part, the one in which \u2018the water was somewhat\nwarmer\u2019.\nEvery time the narrating self evaluates our experiences, it discounts their duration, and adopts the\n\u2018peak-end rule\u2019 \u2013 it remembers only the peak moment and the end moment, and evaluates the whole\nexperience according to their average. This has far-reaching impact on all our practical decisions.\nKahneman began investigating the experiencing self and the narrating self in the early 1990s when,\ntogether with Donald Redelmeier of the University of Toronto, he studied colonoscopy patients. In\ncolonoscopy tests, a tiny camera is inserted into the guts through the anus, in order to diagnose\nvarious bowel diseases. It is not a pleasant experience. Doctors want to know how to perform the test\nin the least painful way. Should they speed up the colonoscopy and cause patients more severe pain\nfor a shorter duration, or should they work more slowly and carefully?\nTo answer this query, Kahneman and Redelmeier asked 154 patients to report the pain during the\ncolonoscopy at one-minute intervals. They used a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 meant no pain at all, and\n10 meant intolerable pain. After the colonoscopy was over, patients were asked to rank the test\u2019s\n\u2018overall pain level\u2019, also on a scale of 0 to 10. We might have expected the overall rank to reflect the\naccumulation of minute-by-minute reports. The longer the colonoscopy lasted, and the more pain the\npatient experienced, the higher the overall pain level. But the actual results were different.\nJust as in the cold-water experiment, the overall pain level neglected duration and instead reflected\nonly the peak-end rule. One colonoscopy lasted eight minutes, at the worst moment the patient\nreported a level 8 pain, and in the last minute he reported a level 7 pain. After the test was over, this\npatient ranked his overall pain level at 7.5. Another colonoscopy lasted twenty-four minutes. This\ntime too peak pain was level 8, but in the very last minute of the test, the patient reported a level 1\npain. This patient ranked his overall pain level only at 4.5. The fact that his colonoscopy lasted three\ntimes as long, and that he consequently suffered far more pain on aggregate, did not affect his memory\nat all. The narrating self doesn\u2019t aggregate experiences \u2013 it averages them.\nSo what do the patients prefer: to have a short and sharp colonoscopy, or a long and careful one?\nThere isn\u2019t a single answer to this question, because the patient has at least two different selves, and\nthey have different interests. If you ask the experiencing self, it will probably prefer a short\ncolonoscopy. But if you ask the narrating self, it will vote for a long colonoscopy because it\nremembers only the average between the worst moment and the last moment. Indeed, from the\nviewpoint of the narrating self, the doctor should add a few completely superfluous minutes of dull\naches at the very end of the test, because it will make the entire memory far less traumatic.\n15\nPaediatricians know this trick well. So do vets. Many keep in their clinics jars full of treats, and\nhand a few to the kids (or dogs) after giving them a painful injection or an unpleasant medical\nexamination. When the narrating self remembers the visit to the doctor, ten seconds of pleasure at the\nend of the visit will erase many minutes of anxiety and pain.\nEvolution discovered this trick aeons before the paediatricians. Given the unbearable torments\nwomen undergo at childbirth, you might think that after going through it once, no sane woman would\never agree to do it again. However, at the end of labour and in the following days the hormonal\nsystem secretes cortisol and beta-endorphins, which reduce the pain and create a feeling of relief and\nsometimes even of elation. Moreover, the growing love towards the baby, and the acclaim from\nfriends, family members, religious dogmas and nationalist propaganda, conspire to turn childbirth\nfrom a terrible trauma into a positive memory.\nAn iconic image of the Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus. In most cultures, childbirth is narrated as a wonderful experience rather than as\na trauma.\nVirgin and Child, Sassoferrato, Il (Giovanni Battista Salvi) (1609\u201385), Musee Bonnat, Bayonne, France \u00a9 Bridgeman Images.\nOne study conducted at the Rabin Medical Center in Tel Aviv showed that the memory of labour\nreflected mainly the peak and end points, while the overall duration had almost no impact at all.\n16\nIn\nanother research project, 2,428 Swedish women were asked to recount their memories of labour two\nmonths after giving birth. Ninety per cent reported that the experience was either positive or very\npositive. They didn\u2019t necessarily forget the pain \u2013 28.5 per cent described it as the worst pain\nimaginable \u2013 yet it did not prevent them from evaluating the experience as positive. The narrating self\ngoes over our experiences with a sharp pair of scissors and a thick black marker. It censors at least\nsome moments of horror, and files in the archive a story with a happy ending.\n17\nMost of our critical life choices \u2013 of partners, careers, residences and holidays \u2013 are taken by our\nnarrating self. Suppose you can choose between two potential holidays. You can go to Jamestown,\nVirginia, and visit the historic colonial town where the first English settlement on mainland North\nAmerica was founded in 1607. Alternatively, you can realise your number one dream vacation,\nwhether it is trekking in Alaska, sunbathing in Florida or having an unbridled bacchanalia of sex,\ndrugs and gambling in Las Vegas. But there is a caveat: if you choose your dream vacation, then just\nbefore you board the plane home, you must take a pill which will wipe out all your memories of that\nvacation. What happened in Vegas will forever remain in Vegas. Which holiday would you choose?\nMost people would opt for colonial Jamestown, because most people give their credit card to the\nnarrating self, which cares only about stories and has zero interest in even the most mind-blowing\nexperiences if it cannot remember them.\nTruth be told, the experiencing self and the narrating self are not completely separate entities but\nare closely intertwined. The narrating self uses our experiences as important (but not exclusive) raw\nmaterials for its stories. These stories, in turn, shape what the experiencing self actually feels. We\nexperience hunger differently when we fast on Ramadan, when we fast in preparation for a medical\nexamination, and when we don\u2019t eat because we have no money. The different meanings ascribed to\nour hunger by the narrating self create very different actual experiences.\nFurthermore, the experiencing self is often strong enough to sabotage the best-laid plans of the\nnarrating self. For example, I can make a New Year resolution to start a diet and go to the gym every\nday. Such grand decisions are the monopoly of the narrating self. But the following week when it\u2019s\ngym time, the experiencing self takes over. I don\u2019t feel like going to the gym, and instead I order pizza,\nsit on the sofa and turn on the TV.\nNevertheless, most people identify with their narrating self. When they say \u2018I\u2019, they mean the story\nin their head, not the stream of experiences they undergo. We identify with the inner system that takes\nthe crazy chaos of life and spins out of it seemingly logical and consistent yarns. It doesn\u2019t matter that\nthe plot is full of lies and lacunas, and that it is rewritten again and again, so that today\u2019s story flatly\ncontradicts yesterday\u2019s; the important thing is that we always retain the feeling that we have a single\nunchanging identity from birth to death (and perhaps even beyond the grave). This gives rise to the\nquestionable liberal belief that I am an individual, and that I possess a consistent and clear inner\nvoice, which provides meaning for the entire universe.\n18\nThe Meaning of Life\nThe narrating self is the star of Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s story \u2018A Problem\u2019.\n19 The story deals with Don\nQuixote, the eponymous hero of Miguel Cervantes\u2019s famous novel. Don Quixote creates for himself an\nimaginary world in which he is a legendary champion going forth to fight giants and save Lady\nDulcinea del Toboso. In reality, Don Quixote is Alonso Quixano, an elderly country gentleman; the\nnoble Dulcinea is an uncouth farm girl from a nearby village; and the giants are windmills. What\nwould happen, wonders Borges, if out of his belief in these fantasies, Don Quixote attacks and kills a\nreal person? Borges asks a fundamental question about the human condition: what happens when the\nyarns spun by our narrating self cause great harm to ourselves or those around us? There are three\nmain possibilities, says Borges.\nOne option is that nothing much happens. Don Quixote will not be bothered at all by killing a real\nman. His delusions are so overpowering that he could not tell the difference between this incident and\nhis imaginary duel with the windmill giants. Another option is that once he takes a real life, Don\nQuixote will be so horrified that he will be shaken out of his delusions. This is akin to a young recruit\nwho goes to war believing that it is good to die for one\u2019s country, only to be completely disillusioned\nby the realities of warfare.\nAnd there is a third option, much more complex and profound. As long as he fought imaginary\ngiants, Don Quixote was just play-acting, but once he actually kills somebody, he will cling to his\nfantasies for all he is worth, because they are the only thing giving meaning to his terrible crime.\nParadoxically, the more sacrifices we make for an imaginary story, the stronger the story becomes,\nbecause we desperately want to give meaning to these sacrifices and to the suffering we have caused.\nIn politics this is known as the \u2018Our Boys Didn\u2019t Die in Vain\u2019 syndrome. In 1915 Italy entered the\nFirst World War on the side of the Entente powers. Italy\u2019s declared aim was to \u2018liberate\u2019 Trento and\nTrieste \u2013 two \u2018Italian\u2019 territories that the Austro-Hungarian Empire held \u2018unjustly\u2019. Italian politicians\ngave fiery speeches in parliament, vowing historical redress and promising a return to the glories of\nancient Rome. Hundreds of thousands of Italian recruits went to the front shouting, \u2018For Trento and\nTrieste!\u2019 They thought it would be a walkover.\nIt was anything but. The Austro-Hungarian army held a strong defensive line along the Isonzo\nRiver. The Italians hurled themselves against the line in eleven gory battles, gaining a few kilometres\nat most, and never securing a breakthrough. In the first battle they lost 15,000 men. In the second\nbattle they lost 40,000 men. In the third battle they lost 60,000. So it continued for more than two\ndreadful years until the eleventh engagement, when the Austrians finally counter-attacked, and in the\nBattle of Caporreto soundly defeated the Italians and pushed them back almost to the gates of Venice.\nThe glorious adventure became a bloodbath. By the end of the war, almost 700,000 Italian soldiers\nwere killed, and more than a million were wounded.\n20\nAfter losing the first Isonzo battle, Italian politicians had two choices. They could admit their\nmistake and sign a peace treaty. Austria\u2013Hungary had no claims against Italy, and would have been\ndelighted to sign a peace treaty because it was busy fighting for survival against the much stronger\nRussians. Yet how could the politicians go to the parents, wives and children of 15,000 dead Italian\nsoldiers, and tell them: \u2018Sorry, there has been a mistake. We hope you don\u2019t take it too hard, but your\nGiovanni died in vain, and so did your Marco.\u2019 Alternatively they could say: \u2018Giovanni and Marco\nwere heroes! They died so that Trieste would be Italian, and we will make sure they didn\u2019t die in\nvain. We will go on fighting until victory is ours!\u2019 Not surprisingly, the politicians preferred the\nsecond option. So they fought a second battle, and lost another 40,000 men. The politicians again\ndecided it would be best to keep on fighting, because \u2018our boys didn\u2019t die in vain\u2019.\nA few of the victims of the Isonzo battles. Was their sacrifice in vain?\n\u00a9 Bettmann/Corbis.\nYet you cannot blame only the politicians. The masses also kept supporting the war. And when after\nthe war Italy did not get all the territories it demanded, Italian democracy placed at its head Benito\nMussolini and his fascists, who promised they would gain for Italy a proper compensation for all the\nsacrifices it had made. While it\u2019s hard for a politician to tell parents that their son died for no good\nreason, it is far more difficult for parents to say this to themselves \u2013 and it is even harder for the\nvictims. A crippled soldier who lost his legs would rather tell himself, \u2018I sacrificed myself for the\nglory of the eternal Italian nation!\u2019 than \u2018I lost my legs because I was stupid enough to believe selfserving politicians.\u2019 It is much easier to live with the fantasy, because the fantasy gives meaning to the\nsuffering.\nPriests discovered this principle thousands of years ago. It underlies numerous religious\nceremonies and commandments. If you want to make people believe in imaginary entities such as\ngods and nations, you should make them sacrifice something valuable. The more painful the sacrifice,\nthe more convinced people are of the existence of the imaginary recipient. A poor peasant sacrificing\na priceless bull to Jupiter will become convinced that Jupiter really exists, otherwise how can he\nexcuse his stupidity? The peasant will sacrifice another bull, and another, and another, just so he\nwon\u2019t have to admit that all the previous bulls were wasted. For exactly the same reason, if I have\nsacrificed a child to the glory of the Italian nation, or my legs to the communist revolution, it\u2019s enough\nto turn me into a zealous Italian nationalist or an enthusiastic communist. For if Italian national myths\nor communist propaganda are a lie, then I will be forced to admit that my child\u2019s death or my own\nparalysis have been completely pointless. Few people have the stomach to admit such a thing.\nThe same logic is at work in the economic sphere too. In 1999 the government of Scotland decided\nto erect a new parliament building. According to the original plan, the construction was supposed to\ntake two years and cost \u00a340 million. In fact, it took five years and cost \u00a3400 million. Every time the\ncontractors encountered unexpected difficulties and expenses, they went to the Scottish government\nand asked for more time and money. Every time this happened, the government told itself: \u2018Well,\nwe\u2019ve already sunk \u00a340 million into this and we\u2019ll be completely discredited if we stop now and end\nup with a half-built skeleton. Let\u2019s authorise another \u00a340 million.\u2019 Six months later the same thing\nhappened, by which time the pressure to avoid ending up with an unfinished building was even\ngreater; and six months after that the story repeated itself, and so on until the actual cost was ten times\nthe original estimate.\nNot only governments fall into this trap. Business corporations often sink millions into failed\nenterprises, while private individuals cling to dysfunctional marriages and dead-end jobs. For the\nnarrating self would much prefer to go on suffering in the future, just so it won\u2019t have to admit that our\npast suffering was devoid of all meaning. Eventually, if we want to come clean about past mistakes,\nour narrating self must invent some twist in the plot that will infuse these mistakes with meaning. For\nexample, a pacifist war veteran may tell himself, \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve lost my legs because of a mistake. But\nthanks to this mistake, I understand that war is hell, and from now onwards I will dedicate my life to\nfight for peace. So my injury did have some positive meaning: it taught me to value peace.\u2019\nThe Scottish Parliament building. Our sterling did not die in vain.\n\u00a9 Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/Getty Images.\nWe see, then, that the self too is an imaginary story, just like nations, gods and money. Each of us\nhas a sophisticated system that throws away most of our experiences, keeps only a few choice\nsamples, mixes them up with bits from movies we saw, novels we read, speeches we heard, and from\nour own daydreams, and weaves out of all that jumble a seemingly coherent story about who I am,\nwhere I came from and where I am going. This story tells me what to love, whom to hate and what to\ndo with myself. This story may even cause me to sacrifice my life, if that\u2019s what the plot requires. We\nall have our genre. Some people live a tragedy, others inhabit a never-ending religious drama, some\napproach life as if it were an action film, and not a few act as if in a comedy. But in the end, they are\nall just stories.\nWhat, then, is the meaning of life? Liberalism maintains that we shouldn\u2019t expect an external entity to\nprovide us with some readymade meaning. Rather, each individual voter, customer and viewer ought\nto use his or her free will in order to create meaning not just for his or her life, but for the entire\nuniverse.\nThe life sciences undermine liberalism, arguing that the free individual is just a fictional tale\nconcocted by an assembly of biochemical algorithms. Every moment, the biochemical mechanisms of\nthe brain create a flash of experience, which immediately disappears. Then more flashes appear and\nfade, appear and fade, in quick succession. These momentary experiences do not add up to any\nenduring essence. The narrating self tries to impose order on this chaos by spinning a never-ending\nstory, in which every such experience has its place, and hence every experience has some lasting\nmeaning. But, as convincing and tempting as it may be, this story is a fiction. Medieval crusaders\nbelieved that God and heaven provided their lives with meaning. Modern liberals believe that\nindividual free choices provide life with meaning. They are all equally delusional.\nDoubts about the existence of free will and individuals are nothing new, of course. Thinkers in\nIndia, China and Greece argued that \u2018the individual self is an illusion\u2019 more than 2,000 years ago. Yet\nsuch doubts don\u2019t really change history unless they have a practical impact on economics, politics and\nday-to-day life. Humans are masters of cognitive dissonance, and we allow ourselves to believe one\nthing in the laboratory and an altogether different thing in the courthouse or in parliament. Just as\nChristianity didn\u2019t disappear the day Darwin published On the Origin of Species, so liberalism\nwon\u2019t vanish just because scientists have reached the conclusion that there are no free individuals.\nIndeed, even Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker and the other champions of the new scientific world\nview refuse to abandon liberalism. After dedicating hundreds of erudite pages to deconstructing the\nself and the freedom of will, they perform breathtaking intellectual somersaults that miraculously land\nthem back in the eighteenth century, as if all the amazing discoveries of evolutionary biology and\nbrain science have absolutely no bearing on the ethical and political ideas of Locke, Rousseau and\nThomas Jefferson.\nHowever, once the heretical scientific insights are translated into everyday technology, routine\nactivities and economic structures, it will become increasingly difficult to sustain this double-game,\nand we \u2013 or our heirs \u2013 will probably require a brand-new package of religious beliefs and political\ninstitutions. At the beginning of the third millennium, liberalism is threatened not by the philosophical\nidea that \u2018there are no free individuals\u2019 but rather by concrete technologies. We are about to face a\nflood of extremely useful devices, tools and structures that make no allowance for the free will of\nindividual humans. Can democracy, the free market and human rights survive this flood?\n9\nThe Great Decoupling\nThe preceding pages took us on a brief tour of recent scientific discoveries that undermine the liberal\nphilosophy. It\u2019s time to examine the practical implications of these scientific discoveries. Liberals\nuphold free markets and democratic elections because they believe that every human is a uniquely\nvaluable individual, whose free choices are the ultimate source of authority. In the twenty-first\ncentury three practical developments might make this belief obsolete:\n1. Humans will lose their economic and military usefulness, hence the economic and political system\nwill stop attaching much value to them.\n2. The system will still find value in humans collectively, but not in unique individuals.\n3. The system will still find value in some unique individuals, but these will be a new elite of\nupgraded superhumans rather than the mass of the population.\nLet\u2019s examine all three threats in detail. The first \u2013 that technological developments will make humans\neconomically and militarily useless \u2013 will not prove that liberalism is wrong on a philosophical\nlevel, but in practice it is hard to see how democracy, free markets and other liberal institutions can\nsurvive such a blow. After all, liberalism did not become the dominant ideology simply because its\nphilosophical arguments were the most accurate. Rather, liberalism succeeded because there was\nmuch political, economic and military sense in ascribing value to every human being. On the mass\nbattlefields of modern industrial wars, and in the mass production lines of modern industrial\neconomies, every human counted. There was value to every pair of hands that could hold a rifle or\npull a lever.\nIn 1793 the royal houses of Europe sent their armies to strangle the French Revolution in its cradle.\nThe firebrands in Paris reacted by proclaiming the lev\u00e9e en masse and unleashing the first total war.\nOn 23 August, the National Convention decreed that \u2018From this moment until such time as its enemies\nshall have been driven from the soil of the Republic, all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for\nthe services of the armies. The young men shall fight; the married men shall forge arms and transport\nprovisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall\nturn old lint into linen; and the old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to\narouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic.\u2019\n1\nThis decree sheds interesting light on the French Revolution\u2019s most famous document \u2013 The\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen \u2013 which recognised that all citizens have equal\nvalue and equal political rights. Is it a coincidence that universal rights were proclaimed at the same\nhistorical juncture that universal conscription was decreed? Though scholars may quibble about the\nexact relations between the two, in the following two centuries a common argument in defence of\ndemocracy explained that giving people political rights is good, because the soldiers and workers of\ndemocratic countries perform better than those of dictatorships. Allegedly, granting people political\nrights increases their motivation and their initiative, which is useful both on the battlefield and in the\nfactory.\nThus Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard from 1869 to 1909, wrote on 5 August 1917 in the\nNew York Times that \u2018democratic armies fight better than armies aristocratically organised and\nautocratically governed\u2019 and that \u2018the armies of nations in which the mass of the people determine\nlegislation, elect their public servants, and settle questions of peace and war, fight better than the\narmies of an autocrat who rules by right of birth and by commission from the Almighty\u2019.\n2\nA similar rationale stood behind the enfranchisement of women in the wake of the First World War.\nRealising the vital role of women in total industrial wars, countries saw the need to give them\npolitical rights in peacetime. Thus in 1918 President Woodrow Wilson became a supporter of\nwomen\u2019s suffrage, explaining to the US Senate that the First World War \u2018could not have been fought,\neither by the other nations engaged or by America, if it had not been for the services of women \u2013\nservices rendered in every sphere \u2013 not only in the fields of effort in which we have been accustomed\nto see them work, but wherever men have worked and upon the very skirts and edges of the battle\nitself. We shall not only be distrusted but shall deserve to be distrusted if we do not enfranchise them\nwith the fullest possible enfranchisement.\u2019\n3\nHowever, in the twenty-first century the majority of both men and women might lose their military\nand economic value. Gone is the mass conscription of the two world wars. The most advanced\narmies of the twenty-first century rely far more on cutting-edge technology. Instead of limitless cannon\nfodder, you now need only small numbers of highly trained soldiers, even smaller numbers of special\nforces super-warriors and a handful of experts who know how to produce and use sophisticated\ntechnology. Hi-tech forces \u2018manned\u2019 by pilotless drones and cyber-worms are replacing the mass\narmies of the twentieth century, and generals delegate more and more critical decisions to algorithms.\nAside from their unpredictability and their susceptibility to fear, hunger and fatigue, flesh-andblood soldiers think and move on an increasingly irrelevant timescale. From the days of\nNebuchadnezzar to those of Saddam Hussein, despite myriad technological improvements, war was\nwaged on an organic timetable. Discussions lasted for hours, battles took days, and wars dragged on\nfor years. Cyber-wars, however, may last just a few minutes. When a lieutenant on shift at cybercommand notices something odd is going on, she picks up the phone to call her superior, who\nimmediately alerts the White House. Alas, by the time the president reaches for the red handset, the\nwar has already been lost. Within seconds, a sufficiently sophisticated cyber strike might shut down\nthe US power grid, wreck US flight control centres, cause numerous industrial accidents in nuclear\nplants and chemical installations, disrupt the police, army and intelligence communication networks \u2013\nand wipe out financial records so that trillions of dollars simply vanish without trace and nobody\nknows who owns what. The only thing curbing public hysteria is that with the Internet, television and\nradio down, people will not be aware of the full magnitude of the disaster.\nOn a smaller scale, suppose two drones fight each other in the air. One drone cannot fire a shot\nwithout first receiving the go-ahead from a human operator in some bunker. The other drone is fully\nautonomous. Which do you think will prevail? If in 2093 the decrepit European Union sends its\ndrones and cyborgs to snuff out a new French Revolution, the Paris Commune might press into service\nevery available hacker, computer and smartphone, but it will have little use for most humans, except\nperhaps as human shields. It is telling that already today in many asymmetrical conflicts the majority\nof citizens are reduced to serving as human shields for advanced armaments.\nLeft: Soldiers in action at the Battle of the Somme, 1916. Right: A pilotless drone.\nLeft: \u00a9 Fototeca Gilardi/Getty Images. Right: \u00a9 alxpin/Getty Images.\nEven if you care more about justice than victory, you should probably opt to replace your soldiers\nand pilots with autonomous robots and drones. Human soldiers murder, rape and pillage, and even\nwhen they try to behave themselves, they all too often kill civilians by mistake. Computers\nprogrammed with ethical algorithms could far more easily conform to the latest rulings of the\ninternational criminal court.\nIn the economic sphere too, the ability to hold a hammer or press a button is becoming less\nvaluable than before. In the past, there were many things only humans could do. But now robots and\ncomputers are catching up, and may soon outperform humans in most tasks. True, computers function\nvery differently from humans, and it seems unlikely that computers will become humanlike any time\nsoon. In particular, it doesn\u2019t seem that computers are about to gain consciousness, and to start\nexperiencing emotions and sensations. Over the last decades there has been an immense advance in\ncomputer intelligence, but there has been exactly zero advance in computer consciousness. As far as\nwe know, computers in 2016 are no more conscious than their prototypes in the 1950s. However, we\nare on the brink of a momentous revolution. Humans are in danger of losing their value, because\nintelligence is decoupling from consciousness.\nUntil today, high intelligence always went hand in hand with a developed consciousness. Only\nconscious beings could perform tasks that required a lot of intelligence, such as playing chess, driving\ncars, diagnosing diseases or identifying terrorists. However, we are now developing new types of\nnon-conscious intelligence that can perform such tasks far better than humans. For all these tasks are\nbased on pattern recognition, and non-conscious algorithms may soon excel human consciousness in\nrecognising patterns. This raises a novel question: which of the two is really important, intelligence\nor consciousness? As long as they went hand in hand, debating their relative value was just a pastime\nfor philosophers. But in the twenty-first century, this is becoming an urgent political and economic\nissue. And it is sobering to realise that, at least for armies and corporations, the answer is\nstraightforward: intelligence is mandatory but consciousness is optional.\nArmies and corporations cannot function without intelligent agents, but they don\u2019t need\nconsciousness and subjective experiences. The conscious experiences of a flesh-and-blood taxi\ndriver are infinitely richer than those of a self-driving car, which feels absolutely nothing. The taxi\ndriver can enjoy music while navigating the busy streets of Seoul. His mind may expand in awe as he\nlooks up at the stars and contemplates the mysteries of the universe. His eyes may fill with tears of\njoy when he sees his baby girl taking her very first step. But the system doesn\u2019t need all that from a\ntaxi driver. All it really wants is to bring passengers from point A to point B as quickly, safely and\ncheaply as possible. And the autonomous car will soon be able to do that far better than a human\ndriver, even though it cannot enjoy music or be awestruck by the magic of existence.\nIndeed, if we forbid humans to drive taxis and cars altogether, and give computer algorithms\nmonopoly over traffic, we can then connect all vehicles to a single network, and thereby make car\naccidents virtually impossible. In August 2015, one of Google\u2019s experimental self-driving cars had an\naccident. As it approached a crossing and detected pedestrians wishing to cross, it applied its brakes.\nA moment later it was hit from behind by a sedan whose careless human driver was perhaps\ncontemplating the mysteries of the universe instead of watching the road. This could not have\nhappened if both vehicles were steered by interlinked computers. The controlling algorithm would\nhave known the position and intentions of every vehicle on the road, and would not have allowed two\nof its marionettes to collide. Such a system will save lots of time, money and human lives \u2013 but it will\nalso do away with the human experience of driving a car and with tens of millions of human jobs.\n4\nSome economists predict that sooner or later, unenhanced humans will be completely useless.\nWhile robots and 3D printers replace workers in manual jobs such as manufacturing shirts, highly\nintelligent algorithms will do the same to white-collar occupations. Bank clerks and travel agents,\nwho a short time ago were completely secure from automation, have become endangered species.\nHow many travel agents do we need when we can use our smartphones to buy plane tickets from an\nalgorithm?\nStock-exchange traders are also in danger. Most trade today is already being managed by computer\nalgorithms, which can process in a second more data than a human can in a year, and that can react to\nthe data much faster than a human can blink. On 23 April 2013, Syrian hackers broke into Associated\nPress\u2019s official Twitter account. At 13:07 they tweeted that the White House had been attacked and\nPresident Obama was hurt. Trade algorithms that constantly monitor newsfeeds reacted in no time,\nand began selling stocks like mad. The Dow Jones went into free fall, and within sixty seconds lost\n150 points, equivalent to a loss of $136 billion! At 13:10 Associated Press clarified that the tweet\nwas a hoax. The algorithms reversed gear, and by 13:13 the Dow Jones had recuperated almost all\nthe losses.\nThree years previously, on 6 May 2010, the New York stock exchange underwent an even sharper\nshock. Within five minutes \u2013 from 14:42 to 14:47 \u2013 the Dow Jones dropped by 1,000 points, wiping\nout $1 trillion. It then bounced back, returning to its pre-crash level in a little over three minutes.\nThat\u2019s what happens when super-fast computer programs are in charge of our money. Experts have\nbeen trying ever since to understand what happened in this so-called \u2018Flash Crash\u2019. We know\nalgorithms were to blame, but we are still not sure exactly what went wrong. Some traders in the USA\nhave already filed lawsuits against algorithmic trading, arguing that it unfairly discriminates against\nhuman beings, who simply cannot react fast enough to compete. Quibbling whether this really\nconstitutes a violation of rights might provide lots of work and lots of fees for lawyers.\n5\nAnd these lawyers won\u2019t necessarily be human. Movies and TV series give the impression that\nlawyers spend their days in court shouting \u2018Objection!\u2019 and making impassioned speeches. Yet most\nrun-of-the-mill lawyers spend their time going over endless files, looking for precedents, loopholes\nand tiny pieces of potentially relevant evidence. Some are busy trying to figure out what happened on\nthe night John Doe got killed, or formulating a gargantuan business contract that will protect their\nclient against every conceivable eventuality. What will be the fate of all these lawyers once\nsophisticated search algorithms can locate more precedents in a day than a human can in a lifetime,\nand once brain scans can reveal lies and deceptions at the press of a button? Even highly experienced\nlawyers and detectives cannot easily spot deceptions merely by observing people\u2019s facial\nexpressions and tone of voice. However, lying involves different brain areas to those used when we\ntell the truth. We\u2019re not there yet, but it is conceivable that in the not too distant future fMRI scanners\ncould function as almost infallible truth machines. Where will that leave millions of lawyers, judges,\ncops and detectives? They might need to go back to school and learn a new profession.\n6\nWhen they get in the classroom, however, they may well discover that the algorithms have got there\nfirst. Companies such as Mindojo are developing interactive algorithms that not only teach me maths,\nphysics and history, but also simultaneously study me and get to know exactly who I am. Digital\nteachers will closely monitor every answer I give, and how long it took me to give it. Over time, they\nwill discern my unique weaknesses as well as my strengths. They will identify what gets me excited,\nand what makes my eyelids droop. They could teach me thermodynamics or geometry in a way that\nsuits my personality type, even if that particular way doesn\u2019t suit 99 per cent of the other pupils. And\nthese digital teachers will never lose their patience, never shout at me, and never go on strike. It is\nunclear, however, why on earth I would need to know thermodynamics or geometry in a world\ncontaining such intelligent computer programs.\n7\nEven doctors are fair game for the algorithms. The first and foremost task of most doctors is to\ndiagnose diseases correctly, and then suggest the best available treatment. If I arrive at the clinic\ncomplaining about fever and diarrhoea, I might be suffering from food poisoning. Then again, the\nsame symptoms might result from a stomach virus, cholera, dysentery, malaria, cancer or some\nunknown new disease. My doctor has only five minutes to make a correct diagnosis, because this is\nwhat my health insurance pays for. This allows for no more than a few questions and perhaps a quick\nmedical examination. The doctor then cross-references this meagre information with my medical\nhistory, and with the vast world of human maladies. Alas, not even the most diligent doctor can\nremember all my previous ailments and check-ups. Similarly, no doctor can be familiar with every\nillness and drug, or read every new article published in every medical journal. To top it all, the\ndoctor is sometimes tired or hungry or perhaps even sick, which affects her judgement. No wonder\nthat doctors often err in their diagnoses, or recommend a less-than-optimal treatment.\nNow consider IBM\u2019s famous Watson \u2013 an artificial intelligence system that won the Jeopardy!\ntelevision game show in 2011, beating human former champions. Watson is currently groomed to do\nmore serious work, particularly in diagnosing diseases. An AI such as Watson has enormous potential\nadvantages over human doctors. Firstly, an AI can hold in its databanks information about every\nknown illness and medicine in history. It can then update these databanks every day, not only with the\nfindings of new researches, but also with medical statistics gathered from every clinic and hospital in\nthe world.\nIBM\u2019s Watson defeating its two humans opponents in Jeopardy! in 2011.\n\u00a9 Sony Pictures Television.\nSecondly, Watson can be intimately familiar not only with my entire genome and my day-to-day\nmedical history, but also with the genomes and medical histories of my parents, siblings, cousins,\nneighbours and friends. Watson will know instantly whether I visited a tropical country recently,\nwhether I have recurring stomach infections, whether there have been cases of intestinal cancer in my\nfamily or whether people all over town are complaining this morning about diarrhoea.\nThirdly, Watson will never be tired, hungry or sick, and will have all the time in the world for me. I\ncould sit comfortably on my sofa at home and answer hundreds of questions, telling Watson exactly\nhow I feel. This is good news for most patients (except perhaps hypochondriacs). But if you enter\nmedical school today in the expectation of still being a family doctor in twenty years, maybe you\nshould think again. With such a Watson around, there is not much need for Sherlocks.\nThis threat hovers over the heads not only of general practitioners, but also of experts. Indeed, it\nmight prove easier to replace doctors specialising in a relatively narrow field such as cancer\ndiagnosis. For example, in a recent experiment a computer algorithm diagnosed correctly 90 per cent\nof lung cancer cases presented to it, while human doctors had a success rate of only 50 per cent.\n8\nIn\nfact, the future is already here. CT scans and mammography tests are routinely checked by specialised\nalgorithms, which provide doctors with a second opinion, and sometimes detect tumours that the\ndoctors missed.\n9\nA host of tough technical problems still prevent Watson and its ilk from replacing most doctors\ntomorrow morning. Yet these technical problems \u2013 however difficult \u2013 need only be solved once. The\ntraining of a human doctor is a complicated and expensive process that lasts years. When the process\nis complete, after ten years of studies and internships, all you get is one doctor. If you want two\ndoctors, you have to repeat the entire process from scratch. In contrast, if and when you solve the\ntechnical problems hampering Watson, you will get not one, but an infinite number of doctors,\navailable 24/7 in every corner of the world. So even if it costs $100 billion to make it work, in the\nlong run it would be much cheaper than training human doctors.\nAnd what\u2019s true of doctors is doubly true of pharmacists. In 2011 a pharmacy opened in San\nFrancisco manned by a single robot. When a human comes to the pharmacy, within seconds the robot\nreceives all of the customer\u2019s prescriptions, as well as detailed information about other medicines\ntaken by them, and their suspected allergies. The robot makes sure the new prescriptions don\u2019t\ncombine adversely with any other medicine or allergy, and then provides the customer with the\nrequired drug. In its first year of operation the robotic pharmacist provided 2 million prescriptions,\nwithout making a single mistake. On average, flesh-and-blood pharmacists get wrong 1.7 per cent of\nprescriptions. In the United States alone this amounts to more than 50 million prescription errors\nevery year!\n10\nSome people argue that even if an algorithm could outperform doctors and pharmacists in the\ntechnical aspects of their professions, it could never replace their human touch. If your CT indicates\nyou have cancer, would you like to receive the news from a caring and empathetic human doctor, or\nfrom a machine? Well, how about receiving the news from a caring and empathetic machine that\ntailors its words to your personality type? Remember that organisms are algorithms, and Watson\ncould detect your emotional state with the same accuracy that it detects your tumours.\nThis idea has already been implemented by some customer-services departments, such as those\npioneered by the Chicago-based Mattersight Corporation. Mattersight publishes its wares with the\nfollowing advert: \u2018Have you ever spoken with someone and felt as though you just clicked? The\nmagical feeling you get is the result of a personality connection. Mattersight creates that feeling every\nday, in call centers around the world.\u2019\n11 When you call customer services with a request or\ncomplaint, it usually takes a few seconds to route your call to a representative. In Mattersight systems,\nyour call is routed by a clever algorithm. You first state the reason for your call. The algorithm listens\nto your request, analyses the words you have chosen and your tone of voice, and deduces not only\nyour present emotional state but also your personality type \u2013 whether you are introverted, extroverted,\nrebellious or dependent. Based on this information, the algorithm links you to the representative that\nbest matches your mood and personality. The algorithm knows whether you need an empathetic\nperson to patiently listen to your complaints, or you prefer a no-nonsense rational type who will give\nyou the quickest technical solution. A good match means both happier customers and less time and\nmoney wasted by the customer-services department.\n12\nThe most important question in twenty-first-century economics may well be what to do with all the\nsuperfluous people. What will conscious humans do, once we have highly intelligent non-conscious\nalgorithms that can do almost everything better?\nThroughout history the job market was divided into three main sectors: agriculture, industry and\nservices. Until about 1800, the vast majority of people worked in agriculture, and only a small\nminority worked in industry and services. During the Industrial Revolution people in developed\ncountries left the fields and herds. Most began working in industry, but growing numbers also took up\njobs in the services sector. In recent decades developed countries underwent another revolution, as\nindustrial jobs vanished, whereas the services sector expanded. In 2010 only 2 per cent of Americans\nworked in agriculture, 20 per cent worked in industry, 78 per cent worked as teachers, doctors,\nwebpage designers and so forth. When mindless algorithms are able to teach, diagnose and design\nbetter than humans, what will we do?\nThis is not an entirely new question. Ever since the Industrial Revolution erupted, people feared\nthat mechanisation might cause mass unemployment. This never happened, because as old professions\nbecame obsolete, new professions evolved, and there was always something humans could do better\nthan machines. Yet this is not a law of nature, and nothing guarantees it will continue to be like that in\nthe future. Humans have two basic types of abilities: physical abilities and cognitive abilities. As\nlong as machines competed with us merely in physical abilities, you could always find cognitive tasks\nthat humans do better. So machines took over purely manual jobs, while humans focused on jobs\nrequiring at least some cognitive skills. Yet what will happen once algorithms outperform us in\nremembering, analysing and recognising patterns?\nThe idea that humans will always have a unique ability beyond the reach of non-conscious\nalgorithms is just wishful thinking. The current scientific answer to this pipe dream can be\nsummarised in three simple principles:\n1. Organisms are algorithms. Every animal \u2013 including Homo sapiens \u2013 is an assemblage of organic\nalgorithms shaped by natural selection over millions of years of evolution.\n2. Algorithmic calculations are not affected by the materials from which you build the calculator.\nWhether you build an abacus from wood, iron or plastic, two beads plus two beads equals four\nbeads.\n3. Hence there is no reason to think that organic algorithms can do things that non-organic algorithms\nwill never be able to replicate or surpass. As long as the calculations remain valid, what does it\nmatter whether the algorithms are manifested in carbon or silicon?\nTrue, at present there are numerous things that organic algorithms do better than non-organic ones, and\nexperts have repeatedly declared that something will \u2018for ever\u2019 remain beyond the reach of nonorganic algorithms. But it turns out that \u2018for ever\u2019 often means no more than a decade or two. Until a\nshort time ago, facial recognition was a favourite example of something which even babies\naccomplish easily but which escaped even the most powerful computers on earth. Today facialrecognition programs are able to recognise people far more efficiently and quickly than humans can.\nPolice forces and intelligence services now use such programs to scan countless hours of video\nfootage from surveillance cameras, tracking down suspects and criminals.\nIn the 1980s when people discussed the unique nature of humanity, they habitually used chess as\nprimary proof of human superiority. They believed that computers would never beat humans at chess.\nOn 10 February 1996, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, laying to\nrest that particular claim for human pre-eminence.\nDeep Blue was given a head start by its creators, who preprogrammed it not only with the basic\nrules of chess, but also with detailed instructions regarding chess strategies. A new generation of AI\nuses machine learning to do even more remarkable and elegant things. In February 2015 a program\ndeveloped by Google DeepMind learned by itself how to play forty-nine classic Atari games. One of\nthe developers, Dr Demis Hassabis, explained that \u2018the only information we gave the system was the\nraw pixels on the screen and the idea that it had to get a high score. And everything else it had to\nfigure out by itself.\u2019 The program managed to learn the rules of all the games it was presented with,\nfrom Pac-Man and Space Invaders to car racing and tennis games. It then played most of them as\nwell as or better than humans, sometimes coming up with strategies that never occur to human\nplayers.\n13\nDeep Blue defeating Garry Kasparov.\n\u00a9 STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images.\nComputer algorithms have recently proven their worth in ball games, too. For many decades,\nbaseball teams used the wisdom, experience and gut instincts of professional scouts and managers to\npick players. The best players fetched millions of dollars, and naturally enough the rich teams got the\ncream of the market, whereas poorer teams had to settle for the scraps. In 2002 Billy Beane, the\nmanager of the low-budget Oakland Athletics, decided to beat the system. He relied on an arcane\ncomputer algorithm developed by economists and computer geeks to create a winning team from\nplayers that human scouts overlooked or undervalued. The old-timers were incensed by Beane\u2019s\nalgorithm transgressing into the hallowed halls of baseball. They said that picking baseball players is\nan art, and that only humans with an intimate and long-standing experience of the game can master it.\nA computer program could never do it, because it could never decipher the secrets and the spirit of\nbaseball.\nThey soon had to eat their baseball caps. Beane\u2019s shoestring-budget algorithmic team ($44 million)\nnot only held its own against baseball giants such as the New York Yankees ($125 million), but\nbecame the first team ever in American League baseball to win twenty consecutive games. Not that\nBeane and Oakland could enjoy their success for long. Soon enough, many other baseball teams\nadopted the same algorithmic approach, and since the Yankees and Red Sox could pay far more for\nboth baseball players and computer software, low-budget teams such as the Oakland Athletics now\nhad an even smaller chance of beating the system than before.\n14\nIn 2004 Professor Frank Levy from MIT and Professor Richard Murnane from Harvard published a\nthorough research of the job market, listing those professions most likely to undergo automation.\nTruck drivers were given as an example of a job that could not possibly be automated in the\nforeseeable future. It is hard to imagine, they wrote, that algorithms could safely drive trucks on a\nbusy road. A mere ten years later, Google and Tesla not only imagine this, but are actually making it\nhappen.\n15\nIn fact, as time goes by, it becomes easier and easier to replace humans with computer algorithms,\nnot merely because the algorithms are getting smarter, but also because humans are professionalising.\nAncient hunter-gatherers mastered a very wide variety of skills in order to survive, which is why it\nwould be immensely difficult to design a robotic hunter-gatherer. Such a robot would have to know\nhow to prepare spear points from flint stones, how to find edible mushrooms in a forest, how to use\nmedicinal herbs to bandage a wound, how to track down a mammoth and how to coordinate a charge\nwith a dozen other hunters. However, over the last few thousand years we humans have been\nspecialising. A taxi driver or a cardiologist specialises in a much narrower niche than a huntergatherer, which makes it easier to replace them with AI.\nEven the managers in charge of all these activities can be replaced. Thanks to its powerful\nalgorithms, Uber can manage millions of taxi drivers with only a handful of humans. Most of the\ncommands are given by the algorithms without any need of human supervision.\n16\nIn May 2014 Deep\nKnowledge Ventures \u2013 a Hong Kong venture-capital firm specialising in regenerative medicine \u2013\nbroke new ground by appointing an algorithm called VITAL to its board. VITAL makes investment\nrecommendations by analysing huge amounts of data on the financial situation, clinical trials and\nintellectual property of prospective companies. Like the other five board members, the algorithm gets\nto vote on whether the firm makes an investment in a specific company or not.\nExamining VITAL\u2019s record so far, it seems that it has already picked up one managerial vice:\nnepotism. It has recommended investing in companies that grant algorithms more authority. With\nVITAL\u2019s blessing, Deep Knowledge Ventures has recently invested in Silico Medicine, which\ndevelops computer-assisted methods for drug research, and in Pathway Pharmaceuticals, which\nemploys a platform called OncoFinder to select and rate personalised cancer therapies.\n17\nAs algorithms push humans out of the job market, wealth might become concentrated in the hands of\nthe tiny elite that owns the all-powerful algorithms, creating unprecedented social inequality.\nAlternatively, the algorithms might not only manage businesses, but actually come to own them. At\npresent, human law already recognises intersubjective entities like corporations and nations as \u2018legal\npersons\u2019. Though Toyota or Argentina has neither a body nor a mind, they are subject to international\nlaws, they can own land and money, and they can sue and be sued in court. We might soon grant\nsimilar status to algorithms. An algorithm could then own a venture-capital fund without having to\nobey the wishes of any human master.\nIf the algorithm makes the right decisions, it could accumulate a fortune, which it could then invest\nas it sees fit, perhaps buying your house and becoming your landlord. If you infringe on the\nalgorithm\u2019s legal rights \u2013 say, by not paying rent \u2013 the algorithm could hire lawyers and sue you in\ncourt. If such algorithms consistently outperform human fund managers, we might end up with an\nalgorithmic upper class owning most of our planet. This may sound impossible, but before dismissing\nthe idea, remember that most of our planet is already legally owned by non-human inter-subjective\nentities, namely nations and corporations. Indeed, 5,000 years ago much of Sumer was owned by\nimaginary gods such as Enki and Inanna. If gods can possess land and employ people, why not\nalgorithms?\nSo what will people do? Art is often said to provide us with our ultimate (and uniquely human)\nsanctuary. In a world where computers replace doctors, drivers, teachers and even landlords,\neveryone would become an artist. Yet it is hard to see why artistic creation will be safe from the\nalgorithms. Why are we so sure computers will be unable to better us in the composition of music?\nAccording to the life sciences, art is not the product of some enchanted spirit or metaphysical soul,\nbut rather of organic algorithms recognising mathematical patterns. If so, there is no reason why nonorganic algorithms couldn\u2019t master it.\nDavid Cope is a musicology professor at the University of California in Santa Cruz. He is also one\nof the more controversial figures in the world of classical music. Cope has written programs that\ncompose concertos, chorales, symphonies and operas. His first creation was named EMI\n(Experiments in Musical Intelligence), which specialised in imitating the style of Johann Sebastian\nBach. It took seven years to create the program, but once the work was done, EMI composed 5,000\nchorales \u00e0 la Bach in a single day. Cope arranged a performance of a few select chorales in a music\nfestival at Santa Cruz. Enthusiastic members of the audience praised the wonderful performance, and\nexplained excitedly how the music touched their innermost being. They didn\u2019t know it was composed\nby EMI rather than Bach, and when the truth was revealed, some reacted with glum silence, while\nothers shouted in anger.\nEMI continued to improve, and learned to imitate Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninov and\nStravinsky. Cope got EMI a contract, and its first album \u2013 Classical Music Composed by Computer \u2013\nsold surprisingly well. Publicity brought increasing hostility from classical-music buffs. Professor\nSteve Larson from the University of Oregon sent Cope a challenge for a musical showdown. Larson\nsuggested that professional pianists play three pieces one after the other: one by Bach, one by EMI,\nand one by Larson himself. The audience would then be asked to vote who composed which piece.\nLarson was convinced people would easily tell the difference between soulful human compositions,\nand the lifeless artefact of a machine. Cope accepted the challenge. On the appointed date, hundreds\nof lecturers, students and music fans assembled in the University of Oregon\u2019s concert hall. At the end\nof the performance, a vote was taken. The result? The audience thought that EMI\u2019s piece was genuine\nBach, that Bach\u2019s piece was composed by Larson, and that Larson\u2019s piece was produced by a\ncomputer.\nCritics continued to argue that EMI\u2019s music is technically excellent, but that it lacks something. It is\ntoo accurate. It has no depth. It has no soul. Yet when people heard EMI\u2019s compositions without being\ninformed of their provenance, they frequently praised them precisely for their soulfulness and\nemotional resonance.\nFollowing EMI\u2019s successes, Cope created newer and even more sophisticated programs. His\ncrowning achievement was Annie. Whereas EMI composed music according to predetermined rules,\nAnnie is based on machine learning. Its musical style constantly changes and develops in reaction to\nnew inputs from the outside world. Cope has no idea what Annie is going to compose next. Indeed,\nAnnie does not restrict itself to music composition but also explores other art forms such as haiku\npoetry. In 2011 Cope published Comes the Fiery Night: 2,000 Haiku by Man and Machine. Of the\n2,000 haikus in the book, some are written by Annie, and the rest by organic poets. The book does not\ndisclose which are which. If you think you can tell the difference between human creativity and\nmachine output, you are welcome to test your claim.\n18\nIn the nineteenth century the Industrial Revolution created a huge new class of urban proletariats,\nand socialism spread because no one else managed to answer their unprecedented needs, hopes and\nfears. Liberalism eventually defeated socialism only by adopting the best parts of the socialist\nprogramme. In the twenty-first century we might witness the creation of a new massive class: people\ndevoid of any economic, political or even artistic value, who contribute nothing to the prosperity,\npower and glory of society.\nIn September 2013 two Oxford researchers, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne,\npublished \u2018The Future of Employment\u2019, in which they surveyed the likelihood of different professions\nbeing taken over by computer algorithms within the next twenty years. The algorithm developed by\nFrey and Osborne to do the calculations estimated that 47 per cent of US jobs are at high risk. For\nexample, there is a 99 per cent probability that by 2033 human telemarketers and insurance\nunderwriters will lose their jobs to algorithms. There is a 98 per cent probability that the same will\nhappen to sports referees, 97 per cent that it will happen to cashiers and 96 per cent to chefs. Waiters\n\u2013 94 per cent. Paralegal assistants \u2013 94 per cent. Tour guides \u2013 91 per cent. Bakers \u2013 89 per cent. Bus\ndrivers \u2013 89 per cent. Construction labourers \u2013 88 per cent. Veterinary assistants \u2013 86 per cent.\nSecurity guards \u2013 84 per cent. Sailors \u2013 83 per cent. Bartenders \u2013 77 per cent. Archivists \u2013 76 per\ncent. Carpenters \u2013 72 per cent. Lifeguards \u2013 67 per cent. And so forth. There are of course some safe\njobs. The likelihood that computer algorithms will displace archaeologists by 2033 is only 0.7 per\ncent, because their job requires highly sophisticated types of pattern recognition, and doesn\u2019t produce\nhuge profits. Hence it is improbable that corporations or government will make the necessary\ninvestment to automate archaeology within the next twenty years.\n19\nOf course, by 2033 many new professions are likely to appear, for example, virtual-world\ndesigners. But such professions will probably require much more creativity and flexibility than your\nrun-of-the-mill job, and it is unclear whether forty-year-old cashiers or insurance agents will be able\nto reinvent themselves as virtual-world designers (just try to imagine a virtual world created by an\ninsurance agent!). And even if they do so, the pace of progress is such that within another decade they\nmight have to reinvent themselves yet again. After all, algorithms might well outperform humans in\ndesigning virtual worlds too. The crucial problem isn\u2019t creating new jobs. The crucial problem is\ncreating new jobs that humans perform better than algorithms.\n20\nThe technological bonanza will probably make it feasible to feed and support the useless masses\neven without any effort on their side. But what will keep them occupied and content? People must do\nsomething, or they will go crazy. What will they do all day? One solution might be offered by drugs\nand computer games. Unnecessary people might spend increasing amounts of time within 3D virtualreality worlds, which would provide them with far more excitement and emotional engagement than\nthe drab reality outside. Yet such a development would deal a mortal blow to the liberal belief in the\nsacredness of human life and of human experiences. What\u2019s so sacred in useless bums who pass their\ndays devouring artificial experiences in La La Land?\nSome experts and thinkers, such as Nick Bostrom, warn that humankind is unlikely to suffer this\ndegradation, because once artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, it might simply\nexterminate humankind. The AI is likely to do so either for fear that humankind would turn against it\nand try to pull its plug, or in pursuit of some unfathomable goal of its own. For it would be extremely\ndifficult for humans to control the motivation of a system smarter than themselves.\nEven preprogramming the system with seemingly benign goals might backfire horribly. One popular\nscenario imagines a corporation designing the first artificial super-intelligence, and giving it an\ninnocent test such as calculating pi. Before anyone realises what is happening, the AI takes over the\nplanet, eliminates the human race, launches a conquest campaign to the ends of the galaxy, and\ntransforms the entire known universe into a giant super-computer that for billions upon billions of\nyears calculates pi ever more accurately. After all, this is the divine mission its Creator gave it.\n21\nAProbability of 87 Per Cent\nAt the beginning of this chapter we identified several practical threats to liberalism. The first is that\nhumans might become militarily and economically useless. This is just a possibility, of course, not a\nprophecy. Technical difficulties or political objections might slow down the algorithmic invasion of\nthe job market. Alternatively, since much of the human mind is still uncharted territory, we don\u2019t\nreally know what hidden talents humans might discover, and what novel jobs they might create to\nreplace the losses. That, however, may not be enough to save liberalism. For liberalism believes not\njust in the value of human beings \u2013 it also believes in individualism. The second threat facing\nliberalism is that in the future, while the system might still need humans, it will not need individuals.\nHumans will continue to compose music, to teach physics and to invest money, but the system will\nunderstand these humans better than they understand themselves, and will make most of the important\ndecisions for them. The system will thereby deprive individuals of their authority and freedom.\nThe liberal belief in individualism is founded on the three important assumptions that we discussed\nearlier in the book:\n1. I am an in-dividual \u2013 i.e. I have a single essence which cannot be divided into any parts or\nsubsystems. True, this inner core is wrapped in many outer layers. But if I make the effort to peel\nthese external crusts, I will find deep within myself a clear and single inner voice, which is my\nauthentic self.\n2. My authentic self is completely free.\n3. It follows from the first two assumptions that I can know things about myself nobody else can\ndiscover. For only I have access to my inner space of freedom, and only I can hear the whispers of\nmy authentic self. This is why liberalism grants the individual so much authority. I cannot trust\nanyone else to make choices for me, because no one else can know who I really am, how I feel and\nwhat I want. This is why the voter knows best, why the customer is always right and why beauty is\nin the eye of the beholder.\nHowever, the life sciences challenge all three assumptions. According to the life sciences:\n1. Organisms are algorithms, and humans are not individuals \u2013 they are \u2018dividuals\u2019, i.e. humans are\nan assemblage of many different algorithms lacking a single inner voice or a single self.\n2. The algorithms constituting a human are not free. They are shaped by genes and environmental\npressures, and take decisions either deterministically or randomly \u2013 but not freely.\n3. It follows that an external algorithm could theoretically know me much better than I can ever know\nmyself. An algorithm that monitors each of the systems that comprise my body and my brain could\nknow exactly who I am, how I feel and what I want. Once developed, such an algorithm could\nreplace the voter, the customer and the beholder. Then the algorithm will know best, the algorithm\nwill always be right, and beauty will be in the calculations of the algorithm.\nDuring the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the belief in individualism nevertheless made good\npractical sense, because there were no external algorithms that could actually monitor me effectively.\nStates and markets may have wished to do exactly that, but they lacked the necessary technology. The\nKGB and FBI had only a vague understanding of my biochemistry, genome and brain, and even if\nagents bugged every phone call I made and recorded every chance encounter on the street, they did\nnot have the computing power to analyse all this data. Consequently, given twentieth-century\ntechnological conditions, liberals were right to argue that nobody can know me better than I know\nmyself. Humans therefore had a very good reason to regard themselves as an autonomous system, and\nto follow their own inner voices rather than the commands of Big Brother.\nHowever, twenty-first-century technology may enable external algorithms to know me far better\nthan I know myself, and once this happens, the belief in individualism will collapse and authority will\nshift from individual humans to networked algorithms. People will no longer see themselves as\nautonomous beings running their lives according to their wishes, and instead become accustomed to\nseeing themselves as a collection of biochemical mechanisms that is constantly monitored and guided\nby a network of electronic algorithms. For this to happen, there is no need of an external algorithm\nthat knows me perfectly, and that never makes any mistakes; it is enough that an external algorithm\nwill know me better than I know myself, and will make fewer mistakes than me. It will then make\nsense to trust this algorithm with more and more of my decisions and life choices.\nWe have already crossed this line as far as medicine is concerned. In the hospital, we are no longer\nindividuals. Who do you think will make the most momentous decisions about your body and your\nhealth during your lifetime? It is highly likely that many of these decisions will be taken by computer\nalgorithms such as IBM\u2019s Watson. And this is not necessarily bad news. Diabetics already carry\nsensors that automatically check their sugar level several times a day, alerting them whenever it\ncrosses a dangerous threshold. In 2014 researchers at Yale University announced the first successful\ntrial of an \u2018artificial pancreas\u2019 controlled by an iPhone. Fifty-two diabetics took part in the\nexperiment. Each patient had a tiny sensor and a tiny pump implanted in his or her stomach. The pump\nwas connected to small tubes of insulin and glucagon, two hormones that together regulate sugar\nlevels in the blood. The sensor constantly measured the sugar level, transmitting the data to an iPhone.\nThe iPhone hosted an application that analysed the information, and whenever necessary gave orders\nto the pump, which injected measured amounts of either insulin or glucagon \u2013 without any need of\nhuman intervention.\n22\nMany other people who suffer from no serious illnesses have begun to use wearable sensors and\ncomputers to monitor their health and activities. The devices \u2013 incorporated into anything from\nsmartphones and wristwatches to armbands and underwear \u2013 record diverse biometric data such as\nblood pressure. The data is then fed into sophisticated computer programs, which advise you how to\nchange your diet and daily routines so as to enjoy improved health and a longer and more productive\nlife.\n23 Google, together with the drug giant Novartis, are developing a contact lens that checks glucose\nlevels in the blood every few seconds, by testing tear contents.\n24 Pixie Scientific sells \u2018smart diapers\u2019\nthat analyse baby poop for clues about the baby\u2019s medical condition. Microsoft has launched the\nMicrosoft Band in November 2014 \u2013 a smart armband that monitors among other things your\nheartbeat, the quality of your sleep and the number of steps you take each day. An application called\nDeadline goes a step further, telling you how many years of life you have left, given your current\nhabits.\nSome people use these apps without thinking too deeply about it, but for others this is already an\nideology, if not a religion. The Quantified Self movement argues that the self is nothing but\nmathematical patterns. These patterns are so complex that the human mind has no chance of\nunderstanding them. So if you wish to obey the old adage and know thyself, you should not waste your\ntime on philosophy, meditation or psychoanalysis, but rather you should systematically collect\nbiometric data and allow algorithms to analyse them for you and tell you who you are and what you\nshould do. The movement\u2019s motto is \u2018Self-knowledge through numbers\u2019.\n25\nIn 2000 the Israeli singer Shlomi Shavan conquered the local playlists with his hit song \u2018Arik\u2019. It\u2019s\nabout a guy who is obsessed with his girlfriend\u2019s ex, Arik. He demands to know who is better in bed\n\u2013 him, or Arik? The girlfriend dodges the question, saying that it was different with each of them. The\nguy is not satisfied and demands: \u2018Talk numbers, lady.\u2019 Well, precisely for such guys, a company\ncalled Bedpost sells biometric armbands you can wear while having sex. The armband collects data\nsuch as heart rate, sweat level, duration of sexual intercourse, duration of orgasm and the number of\ncalories you burnt. The data is fed into a computer that analyses the information and ranks your\nperformance with precise numbers. No more fake orgasms and \u2018How was it for you?\u2019\n26\nPeople who experience themselves through the unrelenting mediation of such devices may begin to\nsee themselves as a collection of biochemical systems more than as individuals, and their decisions\nwill increasingly reflect the conflicting demands of the various systems.\n27 Suppose you have two free\nhours a week, and you are unsure whether to use them in order to play chess or tennis. A good friend\nmay ask: \u2018What does your heart tell you?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 you answer, \u2018as far as my heart is concerned, it\u2019s\nobvious tennis is better. It\u2019s also better for my cholesterol level and blood pressure. But my fMRI\nscans indicate I should strengthen my left pre-frontal cortex. In my family, dementia is quite common,\nand my uncle had it at a very early age. The latest studies indicate that a weekly game of chess can\nhelp delay the onset of dementia.\u2019\nYou can already find much more extreme examples of external mediation in the geriatric wards of\nhospitals. Humanism fantasises about old age as a period of wisdom and awareness. The ideal elder\nmay suffer from bodily ailments and weaknesses, but his mind is quick and sharp, and he has eighty\nyears of insights to dispense. He knows exactly what\u2019s what, and always has good advice for the\ngrandchildren and other visitors. Twenty-first-century octogenarians don\u2019t always look like that.\nThanks to our growing understanding of human biology, medicine keeps us alive long enough for our\nminds and our \u2018authentic selves\u2019 to disintegrate and dissolve. All too often, what\u2019s left is a collection\nof dysfunctional biological systems kept going by a collection of monitors, computers and pumps.\nAt a deeper level, as genetic technologies are integrated into daily life, and as people develop\nincreasingly intimate relations with their DNA, the single self might blur even further, and the\nauthentic inner voice might dissolve into a noisy crowd of genes. When I am faced by difficult\ndilemmas and decisions, I may stop searching for my inner voice, and instead consult my inner\ngenetic parliament.\nOn 14 May 2013 actress Angelina Jolie published an article in the New York Times about her\ndecision to have a double mastectomy. Jolie lived for years under the shadow of breast cancer, as\nboth her mother and grandmother died of it at a relatively early age. Jolie herself did a genetic test\nthat proved she was carrying a dangerous mutation of the BRCA1 gene. According to recent statistical\nsurveys, women carrying this mutation have an 87 per cent probability of developing breast cancer.\nEven though at the time Jolie did not have cancer, she decided to pre-empt the dreaded disease and\nhave a double mastectomy. In the article Jolie explained that \u2018I choose not to keep my story private\nbecause there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of\ncancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene-tested, and that if they have a high risk\nthey, too, will know that they have strong options.\u2019\n28\nDeciding whether to undergo a mastectomy is a difficult and potentially fatal choice. Beyond the\ndiscomforts, dangers and financial costs of the operation and its follow-up treatments, the decision\ncan have far-reaching effects on one\u2019s health, body image, emotional well-being and relationships.\nJolie\u2019s choice, and the courage she showed in going public with it, caused a great stir and won her\ninternational acclaim and admiration. In particular, many hoped that the publicity would increase\nawareness of genetic medicine and its potential benefits.\nFrom a historical perspective, it is interesting to note the critical role algorithms played in this\ncase. When Jolie had to take such an important decision about her life, she did not climb a\nmountaintop overlooking the ocean, watch the sun set into the waves and attempt to connect to her\ninnermost feelings. Instead, she preferred to listen to her genes, whose voice manifested not in\nfeelings but in numbers. Jolie felt no pain or discomfort whatsoever. Her feelings told her: \u2018Relax,\neverything is perfectly fine.\u2019 But the computer algorithms used by her doctors told a different story:\n\u2018You don\u2019t feel anything is wrong, but there is a time bomb ticking in your DNA. Do something about\nit \u2013 now!\u2019\nOf course, Jolie\u2019s emotions and unique personality played a key part too. If another woman with a\ndifferent personality had discovered she was carrying the same genetic mutation, she might well have\ndecided not to undergo a mastectomy. However \u2013 and here we enter the twilight zone \u2013 what if that\nother woman had discovered she carried not only the dangerous BRCA1 mutation, but another\nmutation in the (fictional) gene ABCD3, which impairs a brain area responsible for evaluating\nprobabilities, thereby causing people to underestimate dangers? What if a statistician pointed out to\nthis woman that her mother, grandmother and several other relatives all died young because they\nunderestimated various health risks and failed to take precautionary measures?\nIn all likelihood, you too will make important decisions about your health in the same way as\nAngelina Jolie. You will do a genetic test, a blood test or an fMRI; an algorithm will analyse your\nresults on the basis of enormous statistical databases; and you will then accept the algorithm\u2019s\nrecommendation. This is not an apocalyptic scenario. The algorithms won\u2019t revolt and enslave us.\nRather, the algorithms will be so good in making decisions for us that it would be madness not to\nfollow their advice.\nAngelina Jolie\u2019s first leading role was in the 1993 science-fiction action film Cyborg 2. She played\nCasella Reese, a cyborg developed in the year 2074 by Pinwheel Robotics for corporate espionage\nand assassination. Casella is programmed with human emotions, in order to blend better into human\nsocieties while pursuing her missions. When Casella discovers that Pinwheel Robotics not only\ncontrols her, but also intends to terminate her, she escapes and fights for her life and freedom. Cyborg\n2 is a liberal fantasy about an individual fighting for liberty and privacy against global corporate\noctopuses.\nIn her real life, Jolie preferred to sacrifice privacy and autonomy for health. A similar desire to\nimprove human health may well cause most of us to willingly dismantle the barriers protecting our\nprivate spaces, and allow state bureaucracies and multinational corporations access to our innermost\nrecesses. For instance, allowing Google to read our emails and follow our activities would make it\npossible for Google to alert us to brewing epidemics before they are noticed by traditional health\nservices.\nHow does the UK National Health Service know that a flu epidemic has erupted in London? By\nanalysing the reports of thousands of doctors in hundreds of clinics. And how do all these doctors get\nthe information? Well, when Mary wakes up one morning feeling a bit under the weather, she doesn\u2019t\nrun straight to her doctor. She waits a few hours, or even a day or two, hoping that a nice cup of tea\nwith honey will do the trick. When things don\u2019t improve, she makes an appointment with the doctor,\ngoes to the clinic and describes the symptoms. The doctor types the data into the computer, and\nsomebody up in NHS headquarters hopefully analyses this data together with reports streaming in\nfrom thousands of other doctors, concluding that flu is on the march. All this takes a lot of time.\nGoogle could do it in minutes. All it needs to do is monitor the words Londoners type in their\nemails and in Google\u2019s search engine, and cross-reference them with a database of disease symptoms.\nSuppose on an average day the words \u2018headache\u2019, \u2018fever\u2019, \u2018nausea\u2019 and \u2018sneezing\u2019 appear 100,000\ntimes in London emails and searches. If today the Google algorithm notices they appear 300,000\ntimes, then bingo! We have a flu epidemic. There is no need to wait till Mary goes to her doctor. On\nthe very first morning she woke up feeling a bit unwell, and before going to work she emailed a\ncolleague, \u2018I have a headache, but I\u2019ll be there.\u2019 That\u2019s all Google needs.\nHowever, for Google to work its magic, Mary must allow Google not only to read her messages,\nbut also to share the information with the health authorities. If Angelina Jolie was willing to sacrifice\nher privacy in order to raise awareness of breast cancer, why shouldn\u2019t Mary make a similar sacrifice\nin order to fight epidemics?\nThis isn\u2019t a theoretical idea. In 2008 Google actually launched Google Flu Trends, that tracks flu\noutbreaks by monitoring Google searches. The service is still being developed, and due to privacy\nlimitations it tracks only search words and allegedly avoids reading private emails. But it is already\ncapable of ringing the flu alarm bells ten days before traditional health services.\n29\nA more ambitious project is called the Google Baseline Study. Google intends to build a mammoth\ndatabase on human health, establishing the \u2018perfect health\u2019 profile. This will hopefully make it\npossible to identify even the smallest deviations from the baseline, thereby alerting people to\nburgeoning health problems such as cancer when they can be nipped in the bud. The Baseline Study\ndovetails with an entire line of products called Google Fit. These products will be incorporated into\nwearables such as clothes, bracelets, shoes and glasses, and will collect a never-ending stream of\nbiometrical data. The idea is for Google Fit to feed the Baseline Study with the data it needs.\n30\nYet companies such as Google want to go much deeper than wearables. The market for DNA\ntesting is currently growing in leaps and bounds. One of its leaders is 23andMe, a private company\nfounded by Anne Wojcicki, former wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. The name \u201823andMe\u2019\nrefers to the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that contain our genome, the message being that my\nchromosomes have a very special relationship with me. Anyone who can understand what the\nchromosomes are saying can tell you things about yourself that you never even suspected.\nIf you want to know what, pay 23andMe a mere $99, and they will send you a small package with a\ntube. You spit into the tube, seal it and mail it to Mountain View, California. There the DNA in your\nsaliva is read, and you receive the results online. You get a list of the potential health hazards you\nface, and your genetic predisposition for more than ninety traits and conditions ranging from baldness\nto blindness. \u2018Know thyself\u2019 was never easier or cheaper. Since it is all based on statistics, the size\nof the company\u2019s database is the key to making accurate predictions. Hence the first company to build\na giant genetic database will provide customers with the best predictions, and will potentially corner\nthe market. US biotech companies are increasingly worried that strict privacy laws in the USA\ncombined with Chinese disregard for individual privacy may hand China the genetic market on a\nplate.\nIf we connect all the dots, and if we give Google and its competitors free access to our biometric\ndevices, to our DNA scans and to our medical records, we will get an all-knowing medical health\nservice, which will not only fight epidemics, but will also shield us from cancer, heart attacks and\nAlzheimer\u2019s. Yet with such a database at its disposal, Google could do far more. Imagine a system\nthat, in the words of the famous Police song, watches every breath you take, every move you make\nand every bond you break. A system that monitors your bank account and your heartbeat, your sugar\nlevels and your sexual escapades. It will definitely know you much better than you know yourself.\nThe self-deceptions and self-delusions that trap people in bad relationships, wrong careers and\nharmful habits will not fool Google. Unlike the narrating self that controls us today, Google will not\nmake decisions on the basis of cooked-up stories, and will not be misled by cognitive short cuts and\nthe peak-end rule. Google will actually remember every step we took and every hand we shook.\nMany people will be happy to transfer much of their decision-making processes into the hands of\nsuch a system, or at least consult with it whenever they face important choices. Google will advise us\nwhich movie to see, where to go on holiday, what to study in college, which job offer to accept, and\neven whom to date and marry. \u2018Listen, Google,\u2019 I will say, \u2018both John and Paul are courting me. I like\nboth of them, but in a different way, and it\u2019s so hard to make up my mind. Given everything you know,\nwhat do you advise me to do?\u2019\nAnd Google will answer: \u2018Well, I know you from the day you were born. I have read all your\nemails, recorded all your phone calls, and know your favourite films, your DNA and the entire history\nof your heart. I have exact data about each date you went on, and if you want, I can show you secondby-second graphs of your heart rate, blood pressure and sugar levels whenever you went on a date\nwith John or Paul. If necessary, I can even provide you with accurate mathematical ranking of every\nsexual encounter you had with either of them. And naturally enough, I know them as well as I know\nyou. Based on all this information, on my superb algorithms, and on decades\u2019 worth of statistics about\nmillions of relationships \u2013 I advise you to go with John, with an 87 per cent probability of being more\nsatisfied with him in the long run.\n\u2018Indeed, I know you so well that I also know you don\u2019t like this answer. Paul is much more\nhandsome than John, and because you give external appearances too much weight, you secretly\nwanted me to say \u201cPaul\u201d. Looks matter, of course; but not as much as you think. Your biochemical\nalgorithms \u2013 which evolved tens of thousands of years ago in the African savannah \u2013 give looks a\nweight of 35 per cent in their overall rating of potential mates. My algorithms \u2013 which are based on\nthe most up-to-date studies and statistics \u2013 say that looks have only a 14 per cent impact on the longterm success of romantic relationships. So, even though I took Paul\u2019s looks into account, I still tell\nyou that you would be better off with John.\u2019\n31\nIn exchange for such devoted counselling services, we will just have to give up the idea that\nhumans are individuals, and that each human has a free will determining what\u2019s good, what\u2019s beautiful\nand what is the meaning of life. Humans will no longer be autonomous entities directed by the stories\ntheir narrating self invents. Instead, they will be integral parts of a huge global network.\nLiberalism sanctifies the narrating self, and allows it to vote in the polling stations, in the supermarket\nand in the marriage market. For centuries this made good sense, because though the narrating self\nbelieved in all kinds of fictions and fantasies, no alternative system knew me better. Yet once we have\na system that really does know me better, it will be foolhardy to leave authority in the hands of the\nnarrating self.\nLiberal habits such as democratic elections will become obsolete, because Google will be able to\nrepresent even my own political opinions better than myself. When I stand behind the curtain in the\npolling booth, liberalism instructs me to consult my authentic self, and choose whichever party or\ncandidate reflects my deepest desires. Yet the life sciences point out that when I stand there behind\nthe curtain, I don\u2019t really remember everything I felt and thought in the years since the last election.\nMoreover, I am bombarded by a barrage of propaganda, spin and random memories which might well\ndistort my choices. Just as in Kahneman\u2019s cold-water experiment, in politics too the narrating self\nfollows the peak-end rule. It forgets the vast majority of events, remembers only a few extreme\nincidents and gives a wholly disproportional weight to recent happenings.\nFor four long years I may repeatedly complain about the PM\u2019s policies, telling myself and anyone\nwilling to listen that he will be \u2018the ruin of us all\u2019. However, in the months prior to the elections the\ngovernment cuts taxes and spends money generously. The ruling party hires the best copywriters to\nlead a brilliant campaign, with a well-balanced mixture of threats and promises that speak right to the\nfear centre in my brain. On the morning of the elections I wake up with a cold, which impacts my\nmental processes, and causes me to prefer security and stability over all other considerations. And\nvoila! I send the man who will be \u2018the ruin of us all\u2019 back into office for another four years.\nI could have saved myself from such a fate if I only authorised Google to vote for me. Google\nwasn\u2019t born yesterday, you know. Though it doesn\u2019t ignore the recent tax cuts and the election\npromises, it also remembers what happened throughout the previous four years. It knows what my\nblood pressure was every time I read the morning newspapers, and how my dopamine level\nplummeted while I watched the evening news. Google will know how to screen the spin-doctors\u2019\nempty slogans. Google will also know that illness makes voters lean a bit more to the right than usual,\nand will compensate for this. Google will therefore be able to vote not according to my momentary\nstate of mind, and not according to the fantasies of the narrating self, but rather according to the real\nfeelings and interests of the collection of biochemical algorithms known as \u2018I\u2019.\nNaturally, Google will not always get it right. After all, these are all just probabilities. But if\nGoogle makes enough good decisions, people will grant it increasing authority. As time goes by, the\ndatabases will grow, the statistics will become more accurate, the algorithms will improve and the\ndecisions will be even better. The system will never know me perfectly, and will never be infallible.\nBut there is no need for that. Liberalism will collapse on the day the system knows me better than I\nknow myself. Which is less difficult than it may sound, given that most people don\u2019t really know\nthemselves well.\nA recent study commissioned by Google\u2019s nemesis \u2013 Facebook \u2013 has indicated that already today\nthe Facebook algorithm is a better judge of human personalities and dispositions even than people\u2019s\nfriends, parents and spouses. The study was conducted on 86,220 volunteers who have a Facebook\naccount and who completed a hundred-item personality questionnaire. The Facebook algorithm\npredicted the volunteers\u2019 answers based on monitoring their Facebook Likes \u2013 which webpages,\nimages and clips they tagged with the Like button. The more Likes, the more accurate the predictions.\nThe algorithm\u2019s predictions were compared with those of work colleagues, friends, family members\nand spouses. Amazingly, the algorithm needed a set of only ten Likes in order to outperform the\npredictions of work colleagues. It needed seventy Likes to outperform friends, 150 Likes to\noutperform family members and 300 Likes to outperform spouses. In other words, if you happen to\nhave clicked 300 Likes on your Facebook account, the Facebook algorithm can predict your opinions\nand desires better than your husband or wife!\nIndeed, in some fields the Facebook algorithm did better than the person themself. Participants\nwere asked to evaluate things such as their level of substance use or the size of their social networks.\nTheir judgements were less accurate than those of the algorithm. The research concludes with the\nfollowing prediction (made by the human authors of the article, not by the Facebook algorithm):\n\u2018People might abandon their own psychological judgements and rely on computers when making\nimportant life decisions, such as choosing activities, career paths, or even romantic partners. It is\npossible that such data-driven decisions will improve people\u2019s lives.\u2019\n32\nOn a more sinister note, the same study implies that in the next US presidential elections, Facebook\ncould know not only the political opinions of tens of millions of Americans, but also who among them\nare the critical swing votes, and how these votes might be swung. Facebook could tell you that in\nOklahoma the race between Republicans and Democrats is particularly close, Facebook could\nidentify the 32,417 voters who still haven\u2019t made up their mind, and Facebook could determine what\neach candidate needs to say in order to tip the balance. How could Facebook obtain this priceless\npolitical data? We provide it for free.\nIn the high days of European imperialism, conquistadors and merchants bought entire islands and\ncountries in exchange for coloured beads. In the twenty-first century our personal data is probably the\nmost valuable resource most humans still have to offer, and we are giving it to the tech giants in\nexchange for email services and funny cat videos.\nFrom Oracle to Sovereign\nOnce Google, Facebook and other algorithms become all-knowing oracles, they may well evolve into\nagents and finally into sovereigns.\n33 To understand this trajectory, consider the case of Waze \u2013 a GPSbased navigational application which many drivers use nowadays. Waze isn\u2019t just a map. Its millions\nof users constantly update it about traffic jams, car accidents and police cars. Hence Waze knows to\ndivert you away from heavy traffic, and bring you to your destination through the quickest possible\nroute. When you reach a junction and your gut instinct tells you to turn right, but Waze instructs you to\nturn left, users sooner or later learn that they had better listen to Waze rather than to their feelings.\n34\nAt first sight it seems that the Waze algorithm serves us only as an oracle. We ask a question, the\noracle replies, but it is up to us to make a decision. If the oracle wins our trust, however, the next\nlogical step is to turn it into an agent. We give the algorithm only a final aim, and it acts to realise that\naim without our supervision. In the case of Waze, this may happen when we connect Waze to a selfdriving car, and tell Waze \u2018take the fastest route home\u2019 or \u2018take the most scenic route\u2019 or \u2018take the\nroute which will result in the minimum amount of pollution\u2019. We call the shots, but leave it to Waze to\nexecute our commands.\nFinally, Waze might become sovereign. Having so much power in its hands, and knowing far more\nthan we know, it may start manipulating us, shaping our desires and making our decisions for us. For\nexample, suppose because Waze is so good, everybody starts using it. And suppose there is a traffic\njam on route no. 1, while the alternative route no. 2 is relatively open. If Waze simply lets everybody\nknow that, then all drivers will rush to route no. 2, and it too will be clogged. When everybody uses\nthe same oracle, and everybody believes the oracle, the oracle turns into a sovereign. So Waze must\nthink for us. Maybe it will inform only half the drivers that route no. 2 is open, while keeping this\ninformation secret from the other half. Thereby pressure will ease on route no. 1 without blocking\nroute no. 2.\nMicrosoft is developing a far more sophisticated system called Cortana, named after an AI\ncharacter in their popular Halo video-game series. Cortana is an AI personal assistant which\nMicrosoft hopes to include as an integral feature of future versions of Windows. Users will be\nencouraged to allow Cortana access to all their files, emails and applications, so that it will get to\nknow them, and can offer its advice on myriad matters, as well as becoming a virtual agent\nrepresenting the user\u2019s interests. Cortana could remind you to buy something for your wife\u2019s birthday,\nselect the present, reserve a table at the restaurant and prompt you to take your medicine an hour\nbefore dinner. It could alert you that if you don\u2019t stop reading now, you will be late for an important\nbusiness meeting. As you are about to enter the meeting, Cortana will warn that your blood pressure\nis too high and your dopamine level too low, and based on past statistics, you tend to make serious\nbusiness mistakes in such circumstances. So you had better keep things tentative and avoid committing\nyourself or signing any deals.\nOnce Cortanas evolve from oracles to agents, they might start speaking directly with one another,\non their masters\u2019 behalf. It can begin innocently enough, with my Cortana contacting your Cortana to\nagree on a place and time for a meeting. Next thing I know, a potential employer tells me not to bother\nsending a CV, but simply allow his Cortana to grill my Cortana. Or my Cortana may be approached by\nthe Cortana of a potential lover, and the two will compare notes to decide whether it\u2019s a good match \u2013\ncompletely unbeknown to their human owners.\nAs Cortanas gain authority, they may begin manipulating each other to further the interests of their\nmasters, so that success in the job market or the marriage market may increasingly depend on the\nquality of your Cortana. Rich people owning the most up-to-date Cortana will have a decisive\nadvantage over poor people with their older versions.\nBut the murkiest issue of all concerns the identity of Cortana\u2019s master. As we have seen, humans\nare not individuals, and they don\u2019t have a single unified self. Whose interests, then, should Cortana\nserve? Suppose my narrating self makes a New Year resolution to start a diet and go to the gym every\nday. A week later, when it is time to go to the gym, the experiencing self asks Cortana to turn on the\nTV and order pizza. What should Cortana do? Should it obey the experiencing self, or the resolution\ntaken a week ago by the narrating self?\nYou may well ask whether Cortana is really different from an alarm clock, which the narrating self\nsets in the evening, in order to wake the experiencing self in time for work. But Cortana will have far\nmore power over me than an alarm clock. The experiencing self can silence the alarm clock by\npressing a button. In contrast, Cortana will know me so well that it will know exactly what inner\nbuttons to push in order to make me follow its \u2018advice\u2019.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Cortana is not alone in this game. Google Now and Apple\u2019s Siri are headed in the\nsame direction. Amazon too has algorithms that constantly study you and use their knowledge to\nrecommend products. When I go to Amazon to buy a book, an ad pops up and tells me: \u2018I know which\nbooks you liked in the past. People with similar tastes also tend to love this or that new book.\u2019\nWonderful! There are millions of books in the world, and I can never go over all of them, not to\nmention predicting accurately which ones I would like. How good that an algorithm knows me, and\ncan give me recommendations based on my unique taste.\nAnd this is just the beginning. Today in the US more people read digital books than printed\nvolumes. Devices such as Amazon\u2019s Kindle are able to collect data on their users while they are\nreading the book. For example, your Kindle can monitor which parts of the book you read fast, and\nwhich slow; on which page you took a break, and on which sentence you abandoned the book, never\nto pick it up again. (Better tell the author to rewrite that bit.) If Kindle is upgraded with face\nrecognition and biometric sensors, it can know what made you laugh, what made you sad and what\nmade you angry. Soon, books will read you while you are reading them. And whereas you quickly\nforget most of what you read, Amazon will never forget a thing. Such data will enable Amazon to\nevaluate the suitability of a book much better than ever before. It will also enable Amazon to know\nexactly who you are, and how to turn you on and off.\n35\nEventually, we may reach a point when it will be impossible to disconnect from this all-knowing\nnetwork even for a moment. Disconnection will mean death. If medical hopes are realised, future\npeople will incorporate into their bodies a host of biometric devices, bionic organs and nano-robots,\nwhich will monitor our health and defend us from infections, illnesses and damage. Yet these devices\nwill have to be online 24/7, both in order to be updated with the latest medical news, and in order to\nprotect them from the new plagues of cyberspace. Just as my home computer is constantly attacked by\nviruses, worms and Trojan horses, so will be my pacemaker, my hearing aid and my nanotech immune\nsystem. If I don\u2019t update my body\u2019s anti-virus program regularly, I will wake up one day to discover\nthat the millions of nano-robots coursing through my veins are now controlled by a North Korean\nhacker.\nThe new technologies of the twenty-first century may thus reverse the humanist revolution,\nstripping humans of their authority, and empowering non-human algorithms instead. If you are\nhorrified by this direction, don\u2019t blame the computer geeks. The responsibility actually lies with the\nbiologists. It is crucial to realise that this entire trend is fuelled by biological insights more than by\ncomputer science. It is the life sciences that have concluded that organisms are algorithms. If this is\nnot the case \u2013 if organisms function in an inherently different way to algorithms \u2013 then computers may\nwork wonders in other fields, but they will not be able to understand us and direct our life, and they\nwill certainly be incapable of merging with us. Yet once biologists concluded that organisms are\nalgorithms, they dismantled the wall between the organic and inorganic, turned the computer\nrevolution from a purely mechanical affair into a biological cataclysm, and shifted authority from\nindividual humans to networked algorithms.\nSome people are indeed horrified by this development, but the fact is that millions willingly\nembrace it. Already today many of us give up our privacy and our individuality, record our every\naction, conduct our lives online and become hysterical if connection to the net is interrupted even for\na few minutes. The shifting of authority from humans to algorithms is happening all around us, not as a\nresult of some momentous governmental decision, but due to a flood of mundane choices.\nThe result will not be an Orwellian police state. We always prepare ourselves for the previous\nenemy, even when we face an altogether new menace. Defenders of human individuality stand guard\nagainst the tyranny of the collective, without realising that human individuality is now threatened from\nthe opposite direction. The individual will not be crushed by Big Brother; it will disintegrate from\nwithin. Today corporations and governments pay homage to my individuality, and promise to provide\nmedicine, education and entertainment customised to my unique needs and wishes. But in order to so,\ncorporations and governments first need to break me up into biochemical subsystems, monitor these\nsubsystems with ubiquitous sensors and decipher their working with powerful algorithms. In the\nprocess, the individual will transpire to be nothing but a religious fantasy. Reality will be a mesh of\nbiochemical and electronic algorithms, without clear borders, and without individual hubs.\nUpgrading Inequality\nSo far we have looked at two of the three practical threats to liberalism: firstly, that humans will lose\ntheir value completely; secondly, that humans will still be valuable collectively, but they will lose\ntheir individual authority, and will instead be managed by external algorithms. The system will still\nneed you to compose symphonies, teach history or write computer code, but the system will know you\nbetter than you know yourself, and will therefore make most of the important decisions for you \u2013 and\nyou will be perfectly happy with that. It won\u2019t necessarily be a bad world; it will, however, be a\npost-liberal world.\nThe third threat to liberalism is that some people will remain both indispensable and\nundecipherable, but they will constitute a small and privileged elite of upgraded humans. These\nsuperhumans will enjoy unheard-of abilities and unprecedented creativity, which will allow them to\ngo on making many of the most important decisions in the world. They will perform crucial services\nfor the system, while the system could not understand and manage them. However, most humans will\nnot be upgraded, and they will consequently become an inferior caste, dominated by both computer\nalgorithms and the new superhumans.\nSplitting humankind into biological castes will destroy the foundations of liberal ideology.\nLiberalism can coexist with socio-economic gaps. Indeed, since it favours liberty over equality, it\ntakes such gaps for granted. However, liberalism still presupposes that all human beings have equal\nvalue and authority. From a liberal perspective, it is perfectly all right that one person is a billionaire\nliving in a sumptuous chateau, whereas another is a poor peasant living in a straw hut. For according\nto liberalism, the peasant\u2019s unique experiences are still just as valuable as the billionaire\u2019s. That\u2019s\nwhy liberal authors write long novels about the experiences of poor peasants \u2013 and why even\nbillionaires read such books avidly. If you go to see Les Mis\u00e9rables in Broadway or Covent Garden,\nyou will find that good seats can cost hundreds of dollars, and the audience\u2019s combined wealth\nprobably runs into the billions, yet they still sympathise with Jean Valjean who served nineteen years\nin jail for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving nephews.\nThe same logic operates on election day, when the vote of the poor peasant counts for exactly the\nsame as the billionaire\u2019s. The liberal solution for social inequality is to give equal value to different\nhuman experiences, instead of trying to create the same experiences for everyone. However, what\nwill be the fate of this solution once rich and poor are separated not merely by wealth, but also by\nreal biological gaps?\nIn her New York Times article, Angelina Jolie referred to the high costs of genetic testing. At\npresent, the test Jolie had taken costs $3,000 (which does not include the price of the actual\nmastectomy, the reconstruction surgery and related treatments). This in a world where 1 billion\npeople earn less than $1 per day, and another 1.5 billion earn between $1 and $2 a day.\n36 Even if they\nwork hard their entire life, they will never be able to finance a $3,000 genetic test. And the economic\ngaps are at present only increasing. As of early 2016, the sixty-two richest people in the world were\nworth as much as the poorest 3.6 billion people! Since the world\u2019s population is about 7.2 billion, it\nmeans that these sixty-two billionaires together hold as much wealth as the entire bottom half of\nhumankind.\n37\nThe cost of DNA testing is likely to go down with time, but expensive new procedures are\nconstantly being pioneered. So while old treatments will gradually come within reach of the masses,\nthe elites will always remain a couple of steps ahead. Throughout history the rich enjoyed many\nsocial and political advantages, but there was never a huge biological gap separating them from the\npoor. Medieval aristocrats claimed that superior blue blood was flowing through their veins, and\nHindu Brahmins insisted that they were naturally smarter than everyone else, but this was pure fiction.\nIn the future, however, we may see real gaps in physical and cognitive abilities opening between an\nupgraded upper class and the rest of society.\nWhen scientists are confronted with this scenario, their standard reply is that in the twentieth\ncentury too many medical breakthroughs began with the rich, but eventually benefited the whole\npopulation and helped to narrow rather than widen the social gaps. For example, vaccines and\nantibiotics at first profited mainly the upper classes in Western countries, but today they improve the\nlives of all humans everywhere.\nHowever, the expectation that this process will be repeated in the twenty-first century may be just\nwishful thinking, for two important reasons. First, medicine is undergoing a tremendous conceptual\nrevolution. Twentieth-century medicine aimed to heal the sick. Twenty-first-century medicine is\nincreasingly aiming to upgrade the healthy. Healing the sick was an egalitarian project, because it\nassumed that there is a normative standard of physical and mental health that everyone can and should\nenjoy. If someone fell below the norm, it was the job of doctors to fix the problem and help him or her\n\u2018be like everyone\u2019. In contrast, upgrading the healthy is an elitist project, because it rejects the idea of\na universal standard applicable to all, and seeks to give some individuals an edge over others. People\nwant superior memories, above-average intelligence and first-class sexual abilities. If some form of\nupgrade becomes so cheap and common that everyone enjoys it, it will simply be considered the new\nbaseline, which the next generation of treatments will strive to surpass.\nSecond, twentieth-century medicine benefited the masses because the twentieth century was the age\nof the masses. Twentieth-century armies needed millions of healthy soldiers, and the economy needed\nmillions of healthy workers. Consequently, states established public health services to ensure the\nhealth and vigour of everyone. Our greatest medical achievements were the provision of masshygiene facilities, the campaigns of mass vaccinations and the overcoming of mass epidemics. The\nJapanese elite in 1914 had a vested interest in vaccinating the poor and building hospitals and sewage\nsystems in the slums, because if they wanted Japan to be a strong nation with a strong army and a\nstrong economy, they needed many millions of healthy soldiers and workers.\nBut the age of the masses may be over, and with it the age of mass medicine. As human soldiers and\nworkers give way to algorithms, at least some elites may conclude that there is no point in providing\nimproved or even standard conditions of health for masses of useless poor people, and it is far more\nsensible to focus on upgrading a handful of superhumans beyond the norm.\nAlready today, the birth rate is falling in technologically advanced countries such as Japan and\nSouth Korea, where prodigious efforts are invested in the upbringing and education of fewer and\nfewer children \u2013 from whom more and more is expected. How could huge developing countries like\nIndia, Brazil or Nigeria hope to compete with Japan? These countries resemble a long train. The\nelites in the first-class carriages enjoy health care, education and income levels on a par with the\nmost developed nations in the world. However, the hundreds of millions of ordinary citizens who\ncrowd the third-class carriages still suffer from widespread diseases, ignorance and poverty. What\nwould the Indian, Brazilian or Nigerian elites prefer to do in the coming century? Invest in fixing the\nproblems of hundreds of millions of poor, or in upgrading a few million rich? Unlike in the twentieth\ncentury, when the elite had a stake in fixing the problems of the poor because they were militarily and\neconomically vital, in the twenty-first century the most efficient (albeit ruthless) strategy may be to let\ngo of the useless third-class carriages, and dash forward with the first class only. In order to compete\nwith Japan, Brazil might need a handful of upgraded superhumans far more than millions of healthy\nordinary workers.\nHow can liberal beliefs survive the appearance of superhumans with exceptional physical,\nemotional and intellectual abilities? What will happen if it turns out that such superhumans have\nfundamentally different experiences to normal Sapiens? What if superhumans are bored by novels\nabout the experiences of lowly Sapiens thieves, whereas run-of-the-mill humans find soap operas\nabout superhuman love affairs unintelligible?\nThe great human projects of the twentieth century \u2013 overcoming famine, plague and war \u2013 aimed to\nsafeguard a universal norm of abundance, health and peace for all people without exception. The new\nprojects of the twenty-first century \u2013 gaining immortality, bliss and divinity \u2013 also hope to serve the\nwhole of humankind. However, because these projects aim at surpassing rather than safeguarding the\nnorm, they may well result in the creation of a new superhuman caste that will abandon its liberal\nroots and treat normal humans no better than nineteenth-century Europeans treated Africans.\nIf scientific discoveries and technological developments split humankind into a mass of useless\nhumans and a small elite of upgraded superhumans, or if authority shifts altogether away from human\nbeings into the hands of highly intelligent algorithms, then liberalism will collapse. What new\nreligions or ideologies might fill the resulting vacuum and guide the subsequent evolution of our\ngodlike descendants?\n10\nThe Ocean of Consciousness\nThe new religions are unlikely to emerge from the caves of Afghanistan or from the madrasas of the\nMiddle East. Rather, they will emerge from research laboratories. Just as socialism took over the\nworld by promising salvation through steam and electricity, so in the coming decades new technoreligions may conquer the world by promising salvation through algorithms and genes.\nDespite all the talk of radical Islam and Christian fundamentalism, the most interesting place in the\nworld from a religious perspective is not the Islamic State or the Bible Belt, but Silicon Valley.\nThat\u2019s where hi-tech gurus are brewing for us brave new religions that have little to do with God, and\neverything to do with technology. They promise all the old prizes \u2013 happiness, peace, prosperity and\neven eternal life \u2013 but here on earth with the help of technology, rather than after death with the help\nof celestial beings.\nThese new techno-religions can be divided into two main types: techno-humanism and data\nreligion. Data religion argues that humans have completed their cosmic task, and they should now\npass the torch on to entirely new kinds of entities. We will discuss the dreams and nightmares of data\nreligion in the next chapter. This chapter is dedicated to the more conservative creed of technohumanism, which still sees humans as the apex of creation and clings to many traditional humanist\nvalues. Techno-humanism agrees that Homo sapiens as we know it has run its historical course and\nwill no longer be relevant in the future, but concludes that we should therefore use technology in\norder to create Homo deus \u2013 a much superior human model. Homo deus will retain some essential\nhuman features, but will also enjoy upgraded physical and mental abilities that will enable it to hold\nits own even against the most sophisticated non-conscious algorithms. Since intelligence is\ndecoupling from consciousness, and since non-conscious intelligence is developing at breakneck\nspeed, humans must actively upgrade their minds if they want to stay in the game.\nSeventy thousand years ago the Cognitive Revolution transformed the Sapiens mind, thereby turning\nan insignificant African ape into the ruler of the world. The improved Sapiens minds suddenly had\naccess to the vast intersubjective realm, which enabled us to create gods and corporations, to build\ncities and empires, to invent writing and money, and eventually to split the atom and reach the moon.\nAs far as we know, this earth-shattering revolution resulted from a few small changes in the Sapiens\nDNA, and a slight rewiring of the Sapiens brain. If so, says techno-humanism, maybe a few additional\nchanges to our genome and another rewiring of our brain will suffice for launching a second cognitive\nrevolution. The mental renovations of the first Cognitive Revolution gave Homo sapiens access to the\nintersubjective realm and turned us into the rulers of the planet; a second cognitive revolution might\ngive Homo deus access to unimaginable new realms and turn us into the lords of the galaxy.\nThis idea is an updated variant on the old dreams of evolutionary humanism, which already a\ncentury ago called for the creation of superhumans. However, whereas Hitler and his ilk planned to\ncreate superhumans by means of selective breeding and ethnic cleansing, twenty-first-century techno-\nhumanism hopes to reach the goal far more peacefully, with the help of genetic engineering,\nnanotechnology and brain\u2013computer interfaces.\nGap the Mind\nTechno-humanism seeks to upgrade the human mind and give us access to unknown experiences and\nunfamiliar states of consciousness. However, revamping the human mind is an extremely complex and\ndangerous undertaking. As we saw in Chapter 3, we don\u2019t really understand the mind. We don\u2019t know\nhow minds emerge, or what their function is. Through trial and error we learn how to engineer mental\nstates, but we seldom comprehend the full implications of such manipulations. Worse yet, since we\nare unfamiliar with the full spectrum of mental states, we don\u2019t know what mental aims to set\nourselves.\nWe are akin to the inhabitants of a small isolated island who have just invented the first boat, and\nare about to set sail without a map or even a destination. Indeed, we are in a somewhat worse\ncondition. The inhabitants of our imaginary island at least know that they occupy just a small space\nwithin a large and mysterious sea. We fail to appreciate that we are living on a tiny island of\nconsciousness within a giant ocean of alien mental states.\nJust as the spectrums of light and sound are far larger than what we humans can see and hear, so the\nspectrum of mental states is far larger than what the average human is aware of. We can see light in\nwavelengths of between 400 and 700 nanometres only. Above this small principality of human vision\nextend the unseen but vast realms of infrared, microwaves and radio waves, and below it lie the dark\nkingdoms of ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. Similarly, the spectrum of possible mental states\nmay be infinite, but science has studied only two tiny sections of it: the sub-normative and the\nWEIRD.\nFor more than a century psychologists and biologists have conducted extensive research on people\nsuffering from various psychiatric disorders and mental diseases. Consequently, today we have a very\ndetailed (though far from perfect) map of the sub-normative mental spectrum. Simultaneously,\nscientists have studied the mental states of people considered to be healthy and normative. However,\nmost scientific research about the human mind and the human experience has been conducted on\npeople from Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies, who do not\nconstitute a representative sample of humanity. The study of the human mind has so far assumed that\nHomo sapiens is Homer Simpson.\nIn a groundbreaking 2010 study, Joseph Henrich, Steven J. Heine and Ara Norenzayan\nsystematically surveyed all the papers published between 2003 and 2007 in leading scientific\njournals belonging to six different subfields of psychology. The study found that though the papers\noften make broad claims about the human mind, most of them base their findings on exclusively\nWEIRD samples. For example, in papers published in the Journal of Personality and Social\nPsychology \u2013 arguably the most important journal in the subfield of social psychology \u2013 96 per cent\nof the sampled individuals were WEIRD, and 68 per cent were Americans. Moreover, 67 per cent of\nAmerican subjects and 80 per cent of non-American subjects were psychology students! In other\nwords, more than two-thirds of the individuals sampled for papers published in this prestigious\njournal were psychology students in Western universities. Henrich, Heine and Norenzayan halfjokingly suggested that the journal change its name to the Journal of Personality and Social\nPsychology of American Psychology Students.\n1\nHumans can see only a minuscule part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectrum in its entirety is about 10 trillion times larger than\nthat of visible light. Might the mentalspectrum be equally vast?\n\u2018EM spectrum\u2019. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Commons,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EM_spectrum.svg#/media/File:EM_spectrum.svg.\nPsychology students star in many of the studies because their professors oblige them to take part in\nexperiments. If I am a psychology professor at Harvard it is much easier for me to conduct\nexperiments on my own students than on the residents of a crime-ridden New York slum \u2013 not to\nmention travelling to Namibia and conducting experiments on hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari Desert.\nHowever, it may well be that New York slum-dwellers and Kalahari hunter-gatherers experience\nmental states which we will never discover by forcing Harvard psychology students to answer long\nquestionnaires or stick their heads into fMRI scanners.\nEven if we travel all over the globe and study each and every community, we would still cover\nonly a limited part of the Sapiens mental spectrum. Nowadays, all humans have been touched by\nmodernity, and we are all members of a single global village. Though Kalahari foragers are\nsomewhat less modern than Harvard psychology students, they are not a time capsule from our distant\npast. They too have been influenced by Christian missionaries, European traders, wealthy eco-tourists\nand inquisitive anthropologists (the joke is that in the Kalahari Desert, the typical hunter-gatherer\nband consists of twenty hunters, twenty gatherers and fifty anthropologists).\nBefore the emergence of the global village, the planet was a galaxy of isolated human cultures,\nwhich might have fostered mental states that are now extinct. Different socio-economic realities and\ndaily routines nurtured different states of consciousness. Who could gauge the minds of Stone Age\nmammoth-hunters, Neolithic farmers or Kamakura samurais? Moreover, many pre-modern cultures\nbelieved in the existence of superior states of consciousness, which people might access using\nmeditation, drugs or rituals. Shamans, monks and ascetics systematically explored the mysterious\nlands of mind, and came back laden with breathtaking stories. They told of unfamiliar states of\nsupreme tranquillity, extreme sharpness and matchless sensitivity. They told of the mind expanding to\ninfinity or dissolving into emptiness.\nThe humanist revolution caused modern Western culture to lose faith and interest in superior mental\nstates, and to sanctify the mundane experiences of the average Joe. Modern Western culture is\ntherefore unique in lacking a special class of people who seek to experience extraordinary mental\nstates. It believes anyone attempting to do so is a drug addict, mental patient or charlatan.\nConsequently, though we have a detailed map of the mental landscape of Harvard psychology\nstudents, we know far less about the mental landscapes of Native American shamans, Buddhist monks\nor Sufi mystics.\n2\nAnd that is just the Sapiens mind. Fifty thousand years ago, we shared this planet with our\nNeanderthal cousins. They didn\u2019t launch spaceships, build pyramids or establish empires. They\nobviously had very different mental abilities, and lacked many of our talents. Nevertheless, they had\nbigger brains than us Sapiens. What exactly did they do with all those neurons? We have absolutely\nno idea. But they might well have had many mental states that no Sapiens had ever experienced.\nYet even if we take into account all human species that ever existed, that would still not exhaust the\nmental spectrum. Other animals probably have experiences that we humans can barely imagine. Bats,\nfor example, experience the world through echolocation. They emit a very rapid stream of highfrequency calls, well beyond the range of the human ear. They then detect and interpret the returning\nechoes to build a picture of the world. That picture is so detailed and accurate that the bats can fly\nquickly between trees and buildings, chase and capture moths and mosquitoes, and all the time evade\nowls and other predators.\nThe bats live in a world of echoes. Just as in the human world every object has a characteristic\nshape and colour, so in the bat world every object has its echo-pattern. A bat can tell the difference\nbetween a tasty moth species and a poisonous moth species by the different echoes returning from\ntheir slender wings. Some edible moth species try to protect themselves by evolving an echo-pattern\nsimilar to that of a poisonous species. Other moths have evolved an even more remarkable ability to\ndeflect the waves of the bat radar, so that like stealth bombers they fly around without the bat knowing\nthey are there. The world of echolocation is as complex and stormy as our familiar world of sound\nand sight, but we are completely oblivious to it.\nOne of the most important articles about the philosophy of mind is titled \u2018What Is It Like to Be a\nBat?\u2019\n3\nIn this 1974 article, the philosopher Thomas Nagel points out that a Sapiens mind cannot\nfathom the subjective world of a bat. We can write all the algorithms we want about the bat body,\nabout bat echolocation systems and about bat neurons, but it won\u2019t tell us how it feels to be a bat.\nHow does it feel to echolocate a moth flapping its wings? Is it similar to seeing it, or is it something\ncompletely different?\nTrying to explain to a Sapiens how it feels to echolocate a butterfly is probably as pointless as\nexplaining to a blind mole how it feels to see a Caravaggio. It\u2019s likely that bat emotions are also\ndeeply influenced by the centrality of their echolocation sense. For Sapiens, love is red, envy is green\nand depression is blue. Who knows what echolocations colour the love of a female bat to her\noffspring, or the feelings of a male bat towards his rivals?\nBats aren\u2019t special, of course. They are but one out of countless possible examples. Just as Sapiens\ncannot understand what it\u2019s like to be a bat, we have similar difficulties understanding how it feels to\nbe a whale, a tiger or a pelican. It certainly feels like something; but we don\u2019t know like what. Both\nwhales and humans process emotions in a part of the brain called the limbic system, yet the whale\nlimbic system contains an entire additional part which is missing from the human structure. Maybe\nthat part enables whales to experience extremely deep and complex emotions which are alien to us?\nWhales might also have astounding musical experiences which even Bach and Mozart couldn\u2019t grasp.\nWhales can hear one another from hundreds of kilometres away, and each whale has a repertoire of\ncharacteristic \u2018songs\u2019 that may last for hours and follow very intricate patterns. Every now and then a\nwhale composes a new hit, which other whales throughout the ocean adopt. Scientists routinely\nrecord these hits and analyse them with the help of computers, but can any human fathom these\nmusical experiences and tell the difference between a whale Beethoven and a whale Justin Bieber?\n4\nA spectrogram of a bowhead whale song. How does a whale experience this song? The Voyager record included a whale song in\naddition to Beethoven, Bach and Chuck Berry. We can only hope it is a good one.\n\u00a9 Cornell Bioacoustics Research Program at the Lab of Ornithology.\nNone of this should surprise us. Sapiens don\u2019t rule the world because they have deeper emotions or\nmore complex musical experiences than other animals. So we may be inferior to whales, bats, tigers\nand pelicans at least in some emotional and experiential domains.\nBeyond the mental spectrum of humans, bats, whales and all other animals, even vaster and\nstranger continents may lie in wait. In all probability, there is an infinite variety of mental states that\nno Sapiens, bat or dinosaur ever experienced in 4 billion years of terrestrial evolution, because they\ndid not have the necessary faculties. In the future, however, powerful drugs, genetic engineering,\nelectronic helmets and direct brain\u2013computer interfaces may open passages to these places. Just as\nColumbus and Magellan sailed beyond the horizon to explore new islands and unknown continents, so\nwe may one day set sail towards the antipodes of the mind.\nThe spectrum of consciousness.\nI Smell Fear\nAs long as doctors, engineers and customers focused on healing mental diseases and enjoying life in\nWEIRD societies, the study of subnormal mental states and WEIRD minds was perhaps sufficient to\nour needs. Though normative psychology is often accused of mistreating any divergence from the\nnorm, in the last century it has brought relief to countless people, saving the lives and sanity of\nmillions.\nHowever, at the beginning of the third millennium we face a completely different kind of challenge,\nas liberal humanism makes way for techno-humanism, and medicine is increasingly focused on\nupgrading the healthy rather than healing the sick. Doctors, engineers and customers no longer want\nmerely to fix mental problems \u2013 they seek to upgrade the mind. We are acquiring the technical\nabilities to begin manufacturing new states of consciousness, yet we lack a map of these potential new\nterritories. Since we are familiar mainly with the normative and sub-normative mental spectrum of\nWEIRD people, we don\u2019t even know what destinations to aim towards.\nNot surprisingly, then, positive psychology has become the trendiest subfield of the discipline. In\nthe 1990s leading experts such as Martin Seligman, Ed Dinner and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argued\nthat psychology should study not just mental illnesses, but also mental strengths. How come we have a\nremarkably detailed atlas of the sick mind, but have no scientific map of the prosperous mind? Over\nthe last two decades, positive psychology has made important first steps in the study of supernormative mental states, but as of 2016, the super-normative zone is largely terra incognita to science.\nUnder such circumstances, we might rush forward without any map, and focus on upgrading those\nmental abilities that the current economic and political system needs, while neglecting and even\ndowngrading other abilities. Of course, this is not a completely new phenomenon. For thousands of\nyears the system has been shaping and reshaping our minds according to its needs. Sapiens originally\nevolved as members of small intimate communities, and their mental faculties were not adapted to\nliving as cogs within a giant machine. However, with the rise of cities, kingdoms and empires, the\nsystem cultivated capacities required for large-scale cooperation, while disregarding other skills and\ntalents.\nFor example, archaic humans probably made extensive use of their sense of smell. Huntergatherers are able to smell from a distance the difference between various animal species, various\nhumans and even various emotions. Fear, for example, smells different to courage. When a man is\nafraid he secretes different chemicals compared to when he is full of courage. If you sat among an\narchaic band debating whether to start a war against a neighbouring band, you could literary smell\npublic opinion.\nAs Sapiens organised themselves in larger groups, our nose lost its importance, because it is useful\nonly when dealing with small numbers of individuals. You cannot, for example, smell the American\nfear of China. Consequently, human olfactory powers were neglected. Brain areas that tens of\nthousands of years ago probably dealt with odours were put to work on more urgent tasks such as\nreading, mathematics and abstract reasoning. The system prefers that our neurons solve differential\nequations rather than smell our neighbours.\n5\nThe same thing happened to our other senses, and to the underlying ability to pay attention to our\nsensations. Ancient foragers were always sharp and attentive. Wandering in the forest in search of\nmushrooms, they sniffed the wind carefully and watched the ground intently. When they found a\nmushroom, they ate it with the utmost attention, aware of every little nuance of flavour, which could\ndistinguish an edible mushroom from its poisonous cousin. Members of today\u2019s affluent societies\ndon\u2019t need such keen awareness. We can go to the supermarket and buy any of a thousand different\ndishes, all supervised by the health authorities. But whatever we choose \u2013 Italian pizza or Thai\nnoodles \u2013 we are likely to eat it in haste in front of the TV, hardly paying attention to the taste (which\nis why food producers are constantly inventing new exciting flavours, which might somehow pierce\nthe curtain of indifference). Similarly, when going on holiday we can choose between thousands of\namazing destinations. But wherever we go, we are likely to be playing with our smartphone instead of\nreally seeing the place. We have more choice than ever before, but no matter what we choose, we\nhave lost the ability to really pay attention to it.\n6\nIn addition to smelling and paying attention, we have also been losing our ability to dream. Many\ncultures believed that what people see and do in their dreams is no less important than what they see\nand do while awake. Hence people actively developed their ability to dream, to remember dreams\nand even to control their actions in the dream world, which is known as \u2018lucid dreaming\u2019. Experts in\nlucid dreaming could move about the dream world at will, and claimed they could even travel to\nhigher planes of existence or meet visitors from other worlds. The modern world, in contrast,\ndismisses dreams as subconscious messages at best, and mental garbage at worst. Consequently,\ndreams play a much smaller part in our lives, few people actively develop their dreaming skills, and\nmany people claim that they don\u2019t dream at all, or that they cannot remember any of their dreams.\n7\nDid the decline in our capacity to smell, to pay attention and to dream make our lives poorer and\ngreyer? Maybe. But even if it did, for the economic and political system it was worth it. Mathematical\nskills are more important to the economy than smelling flowers or dreaming about fairies. For similar\nreasons, it is likely that future upgrades to the human mind will reflect political needs and market\nforces.\nFor example, the US army\u2019s \u2018attention helmet\u2019 is meant to help people focus on well-defined tasks\nand speed up their decision-making process. It may, however, reduce their ability to show empathy\nand tolerate doubts and inner conflicts. Humanist psychologists have pointed out that people in\ndistress often don\u2019t want a quick fix \u2013 they want somebody to listen to them and sympathise with their\nfears and misgivings. Suppose you are having an ongoing crisis in your workplace, because your new\nboss doesn\u2019t appreciate your views, and insists on doing everything her way. After one particularly\nunhappy day, you pick up the phone and call a friend. But the friend has little time and energy for you,\nso he cuts you short, and tries to solve your problem: \u2018Okay. I get it. Well, you really have just two\noptions here: either quit the job, or stay and do what the boss wants. And if I were you, I would quit.\u2019\nThat would hardly help. A really good friend will have patience, and will not be quick to find a\nsolution. He will listen to your distress, and will provide time and space for all your contradictory\nemotions and gnawing anxieties to surface.\nThe attention helmet works a bit like the impatient friend. Of course sometimes \u2013 on the battlefield,\nfor instance \u2013 people need to take firm decisions quickly. But there is more to life than that. If we start\nusing the attention helmet in more and more situations, we may end up losing our ability to tolerate\nconfusion, doubts and contradictions, just as we have lost our ability to smell, dream and pay\nattention. The system may push us in that direction, because it usually rewards us for the decisions we\nmake rather than for our doubts. Yet a life of resolute decisions and quick fixes may be poorer and\nshallower than one of doubts and contradictions.\nWhen you mix a practical ability to engineer minds with our ignorance of the mental spectrum and\nwith the narrow interests of governments, armies and corporations, you get a recipe for trouble. We\nmay successfully upgrade our bodies and our brains, while losing our minds in the process. Indeed,\ntechno-humanism may end up downgrading humans. The system may prefer downgraded humans not\nbecause they would possess any superhuman knacks, but because they would lack some really\ndisturbing human qualities that hamper the system and slow it down. As any farmer knows, it\u2019s\nusually the brightest goat in the herd that stirs up the greatest trouble, which is why the Agricultural\nRevolution involved downgrading animal mental abilities. The second cognitive revolution dreamed\nup by techno-humanists might do the same to us.\nThe Nail on Which the Universe Hangs\nTechno-humanism faces another dire threat. Like all humanist sects, techno-humanism too sanctifies\nthe human will, seeing it as the nail on which the entire universe hangs. Techno-humanism expects our\ndesires to choose which mental abilities to develop, and to thereby determine the shape of future\nminds. Yet what would happen once technological progress makes it possible to reshape and engineer\nour desires themselves?\nHumanism always emphasised that it is not easy to identify our authentic will. When we try to\nlisten to ourselves, we are often flooded by a cacophony of conflicting noises. Indeed, we sometimes\ndon\u2019t really want to hear our authentic voice, because it can disclose unwelcome secrets and make\nuncomfortable requests. Many people take great care not to probe themselves too deeply. A\nsuccessful lawyer on the fast track may stifle an inner voice telling her to take a break and have a\nchild. A woman trapped in a dissatisfying marriage fears losing the security it provides. A guiltridden soldier is stalked by nightmares about atrocities he committed. A young man unsure of his\nsexuality follows a personal \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy. Humanism doesn\u2019t think any of these\nsituations has an obvious one-size-fits-all solution. But humanism demands that we show some guts,\nlisten to the inner messages even if they scare us, identify our authentic voice and then follow its\ninstructions regardless of the difficulties.\nTechnological progress has a very different agenda. It doesn\u2019t want to listen to our inner voices. It\nwants to control them. Once we understand the biochemical system producing all these voices, we\ncan play with the switches, turn up the volume here, lower it there, and make life much more easy and\ncomfortable. We\u2019ll give Ritalin to the distracted lawyer, Prozac to the guilty soldier and Cipralex to\nthe dissatisfied wife. And that\u2019s just the beginning.\nHumanists are often appalled by this approach, but we had better not pass judgement on it too\nquickly. The humanist recommendation to listen to ourselves has ruined the lives of many a person,\nwhereas the right dosage of the right chemical has greatly improved the well-being and relationships\nof millions. In order to really listen to themselves, some people must first turn down the volume of the\ninner screams and diatribes. According to modern psychiatry, many \u2018inner voices\u2019 and \u2018authentic\nwishes\u2019 are nothing more than the product of biochemical imbalances and neurological diseases.\nPeople suffering from clinical depression repeatedly walk out on promising careers and healthy\nrelationships because some biochemical glitch makes them see everything through dark-coloured\nlenses. Instead of listening to such destructive inner voices, it might be a good idea to shut them up.\nWhen Sally Adee used the attention helmet to silence the voices in her head, she not only became an\nexpert markswoman, but she also felt much better about herself.\nPersonally, you may have many different views about these issues. Yet from a historical\nperspective it is clear that something momentous is happening. The number one humanist\ncommandment \u2013 listen to yourself! \u2013 is no longer self-evident. As we learn to turn our inner volume\nup and down, we give up our belief in authenticity, because it is no longer clear whose hand is on the\nswitch. Silencing annoying noises inside your head seems like a wonderful idea, provided it enables\nyou to finally hear your deep authentic self. But if there is no authentic self, how do you decide which\nvoices to silence and which to amplify?\nLet\u2019s assume, just for the sake of argument, that within a few decades brain scientists will give us\neasy and accurate control over many inner voices. Imagine a young gay man from a devout Mormon\nfamily, who after years of living in the closet has finally accumulated enough money to finance a\npassion operation. He goes to the clinic armed with $100,000, determined to walk out of it as straight\nas Joseph Smith. Standing in front of the clinic\u2019s door, he mentally repeats what he is going to say to\nthe doctor: \u2018Doc, here\u2019s $100,000. Please fix me so that I will never want men again.\u2019 He then rings\nthe bell, and the door is opened by a real-life George Clooney. \u2018Doc,\u2019 mumbles the overwhelmed lad,\n\u2018here\u2019s $100,000. Please fix me so that I will never want to be straight again.\u2019\nDid the young man\u2019s authentic self win over the religious brainwashing he underwent? Or perhaps\na moment\u2019s temptation caused him to betray himself? And perhaps there is simply no such thing as an\nauthentic self that you can follow or betray? Once people could design and redesign their will, we\ncould no longer see it as the ultimate source of all meaning and authority. For no matter what our will\nsays, we can always make it say something else.\nAccording to humanism, only human desires imbue the world with meaning. Yet if we could choose\nour desires, on what basis could we possibly make such choices? Suppose Romeo and Juliet opened\nwith Romeo having to decide with whom to fall in love. And suppose even after making a decision,\nRomeo could always retract and make a different choice instead. What kind of play would it have\nbeen? Well, that\u2019s the play technological progress is trying to produce for us. When our desires make\nus uncomfortable, technology promises to bail us out. When the nail on which the entire universe\nhangs is pegged in a problematic spot, technology would pull it out and stick it somewhere else. But\nwhere exactly? If I could peg that nail anywhere in the cosmos, where should I peg it, and why there\nof all places?\nHumanist dramas unfold when people have uncomfortable desires. For example, it is extremely\nuncomfortable when Romeo of the house of Montague falls in love with Juliet of the house of Capulet,\nbecause the Montagues and Capulets are bitter enemies. The technological solution to such dramas is\nto make sure we never have uncomfortable desires. How much pain and sorrow would have been\navoided if instead of drinking poison, Romeo and Juliet could just take a pill or wear a helmet that\nwould have redirected their star-crossed love towards other people.\nTechno-humanism faces an impossible dilemma here. It considers the human will to be the most\nimportant thing in the universe, hence it pushes humankind to develop technologies that can control\nand redesign our will. After all, it\u2019s tempting to gain control over the most important thing in the\nworld. Yet once we have such control, techno-humanism would not know what to do with it, because\nthe sacred human will would become just another designer product. We can never deal with such\ntechnologies as long as we believe that the human will and the human experience are the supreme\nsource of authority and meaning.\nHence a bolder techno-religion seeks to sever the humanist umbilical cord altogether. It foresees a\nworld which does not revolve around the desires and experiences of any humanlike beings. What\nmight replace desires and experiences as the source of all meaning and authority? As of 2016, only\none candidate is sitting in history\u2019s reception room waiting for the job interview. This candidate is\ninformation. The most interesting emerging religion is Dataism, which venerates neither gods nor man\n\u2013 it worships data.\n11\nThe Data Religion\nDataism says that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is\ndetermined by its contribution to data processing.\n1 This may strike you as some eccentric fringe\nnotion, but in fact it has already conquered most of the scientific establishment. Dataism was born\nfrom the explosive confluence of two scientific tidal waves. In the 150 years since Charles Darwin\npublished On the Origin of Species, the life sciences have come to see organisms as biochemical\nalgorithms. Simultaneously, in the eight decades since Alan Turing formulated the idea of a Turing\nMachine, computer scientists have learned to engineer increasingly sophisticated electronic\nalgorithms. Dataism puts the two together, pointing out that exactly the same mathematical laws apply\nto both biochemical and electronic algorithms. Dataism thereby collapses the barrier between\nanimals and machines, and expects electronic algorithms to eventually decipher and outperform\nbiochemical algorithms.\nFor politicians, business people and ordinary consumers, Dataism offers groundbreaking\ntechnologies and immense new powers. For scholars and intellectuals it also promises to provide the\nscientific holy grail that has eluded us for centuries: a single overarching theory that unifies all the\nscientific disciplines from literature and musicology to economics and biology. According to\nDataism, King Lear and the flu virus are just two patterns of data flow that can be analysed using the\nsame basic concepts and tools. This idea is extremely attractive. It gives all scientists a common\nlanguage, builds bridges over academic rifts and easily exports insights across disciplinary borders.\nMusicologists, political scientists and cell biologists can finally understand each other.\nIn the process, Dataism inverts the traditional pyramid of learning. Hitherto, data was seen as only\nthe first step in a long chain of intellectual activity. Humans were supposed to distil data into\ninformation, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom. However, Dataists believe\nthat humans can no longer cope with the immense flows of data, hence they cannot distil data into\ninformation, let alone into knowledge or wisdom. The work of processing data should therefore be\nentrusted to electronic algorithms, whose capacity far exceeds that of the human brain. In practice,\nthis means that Dataists are sceptical about human knowledge and wisdom, and prefer to put their\ntrust in Big Data and computer algorithms.\nDataism is most firmly entrenched in its two mother disciplines: computer science and biology. Of\nthe two, biology is the more important. It was the biological embracement of Dataism that turned a\nlimited breakthrough in computer science into a world-shattering cataclysm that may completely\ntransform the very nature of life. You may not agree with the idea that organisms are algorithms, and\nthat giraffes, tomatoes and human beings are just different methods for processing data. But you\nshould know that this is current scientific dogma, and that it is changing our world beyond\nrecognition.\nNot only individual organisms are seen today as data-processing systems, but also entire societies\nsuch as beehives, bacteria colonies, forests and human cities. Economists increasingly interpret the\neconomy, too, as a data-processing system. Laypeople believe that the economy consists of peasants\ngrowing wheat, workers manufacturing clothes, and customers buying bread and underpants. Yet\nexperts see the economy as a mechanism for gathering data about desires and abilities, and turning\nthis data into decisions.\nAccording to this view, free-market capitalism and state-controlled communism aren\u2019t competing\nideologies, ethical creeds or political institutions. At bottom, they are competing data-processing\nsystems. Capitalism uses distributed processing, whereas communism relies on centralised\nprocessing. Capitalism processes data by directly connecting all producers and consumers to one\nanother, and allowing them to exchange information freely and make decisions independently. For\nexample, how do you determine the price of bread in a free market? Well, every bakery may produce\nas much bread as it likes, and charge for it as much as it wants. The customers are equally free to buy\nas much bread as they can afford, or take their business to the competitor. It isn\u2019t illegal to charge\n$1,000 for a baguette, but nobody is likely to buy it.\nOn a much grander scale, if investors predict increased demand for bread, they will buy shares of\nbiotech firms that genetically engineer more prolific wheat strains. The inflow of capital will enable\nthe firms to speed up their research, thereby providing more wheat faster, and averting bread\nshortages. Even if one biotech giant adopts a flawed theory and reaches an impasse, its more\nsuccessful competitors will achieve the hoped-for breakthrough. Free-market capitalism thus\ndistributes the work of analysing data and making decisions between many independent but\ninterconnected processors. As the Austrian economics guru Friedrich Hayek explained, \u2018In a system\nin which the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed among many people, prices can act to\ncoordinate the separate actions of different people.\u2019\n2\nAccording to this view, the stock exchange is the fastest and most efficient data-processing system\nhumankind has so far created. Everyone is welcome to join, if not directly then through their banks or\npension funds. The stock exchange runs the global economy, and takes into account everything that\nhappens all over the planet \u2013 and even beyond it. Prices are influenced by successful scientific\nexperiments, by political scandals in Japan, by volcanic eruptions in Iceland and even by irregular\nactivities on the surface of the sun. In order for the system to run smoothly, as much information as\npossible needs to flow as freely as possible. When millions of people throughout the world have\naccess to all the relevant information, they determine the most accurate price of oil, of Hyundai shares\nand of Swedish government bonds by buying and selling them. It has been estimated that the stock\nexchange needs just fifteen minutes of trade to determine the influence of a New York Times headline\non the prices of most shares.\n3\nData-processing considerations also explain why capitalists favour lower taxes. Heavy taxation\nmeans that a large part of all available capital accumulates in one place \u2013 the state coffers \u2013 and\nconsequently more and more decisions have to be made by a single processor, namely the\ngovernment. This creates an overly centralised data-processing system. In extreme cases, when taxes\nare exceedingly high, almost all capital ends up in the government\u2019s hands, and so the government\nalone calls the shots. It dictates the price of bread, the location of bakeries, and the research-anddevelopment budget. In a free market, if one processor makes a wrong decision, others will be quick\nto utilise its mistake. However, when a single processor makes almost all the decisions, mistakes can\nbe catastrophic.\nThis extreme situation in which all data is processed and all decisions are made by a single central\nprocessor is called communism. In a communist economy, people allegedly work according to their\nabilities, and receive according to their needs. In other words, the government takes 100 per cent of\nyour profits, decides what you need and then supplies these needs. Though no country ever realised\nthis scheme in its extreme form, the Soviet Union and its satellites came as close as they could. They\nabandoned the principle of distributed data processing, and switched to a model of centralised data\nprocessing. All information from throughout the Soviet Union flowed to a single location in Moscow,\nwhere all the important decisions were made. Producers and consumers could not communicate\ndirectly, and had to obey government orders.\nThe Soviet leadership in Moscow, 1963: centralised data processing.\n\u00a9 ITAR-TASS Photo Agency/Alamy Stock Photo.\nFor instance, the Soviet economics ministry might decide that the price of bread in all shops should\nbe exactly two roubles and four kopeks, that a particular kolkhoz in the Odessa oblast should switch\nfrom growing wheat to raising chickens, and that the Red October bakery in Moscow should produce\n3.5 million loaves of bread per day, and not a single loaf more. Meanwhile the Soviet science\nministry forced all Soviet biotech laboratories to adopt the theories of Trofim Lysenko \u2013 the infamous\nhead of the Lenin Academy for Agricultural Sciences. Lysenko rejected the dominant genetic theories\nof his day. He insisted that if an organism acquired some new trait during its lifetime, this quality\ncould pass directly to its descendants. This idea flew in the face of Darwinian orthodoxy, but it\ndovetailed nicely with communist educational principles. It implied that if you could train wheat\nplants to withstand cold weather, their progenies will also be cold-resistant. Lysenko accordingly\nsent billions of counter-revolutionary wheat plants to be re-educated in Siberia \u2013 and the Soviet\nUnion was soon forced to import more and more flour from the United States.\n4\nCommotion on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade: distributed data processing.\n\u00a9 Jonathan Kirn/Getty Images.\nCapitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual\nliberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won\nthe Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at\nleast in periods of accelerating technological changes. The central committee of the Communist Party\njust could not deal with the rapidly changing world of the late twentieth century. When all data is\naccumulated in one secret bunker, and all important decisions are taken by a group of elderly\napparatchiks, you can produce nuclear bombs by the cartload, but you won\u2019t get an Apple or a\nWikipedia.\nThere is a story (probably apocryphal, like most good stories) that when Mikhail Gorbachev tried\nto resuscitate the moribund Soviet economy, he sent one of his chief aids to London to find out what\nThatcherism was all about, and how a capitalist system actually functioned. The hosts took their\nSoviet visitor on a tour of the City, of the London stock exchange and of the London School of\nEconomics, where he had lengthy talks with bank managers, entrepreneurs and professors. After a\nfew hours, the Soviet expert burst out: \u2018Just one moment, please. Forget about all these complicated\neconomic theories. We have been going back and forth across London for a whole day now, and\nthere\u2019s one thing I cannot understand. Back in Moscow, our finest minds are working on the bread\nsupply system, and yet there are such long queues in every bakery and grocery store. Here in London\nlive millions of people, and we have passed today in front of many shops and supermarkets, yet I\nhaven\u2019t seen a single bread queue. Please take me to meet the person in charge of supplying bread to\nLondon. I must learn his secret.\u2019 The hosts scratched their heads, thought for a moment, and said:\n\u2018Nobody is in charge of supplying bread to London.\u2019\nThat\u2019s the capitalist secret of success. No central processing unit monopolises all the data on the\nLondon bread supply. The information flows freely between millions of consumers and producers,\nbakers and tycoons, farmers and scientists. Market forces determine the price of bread, the number of\nloaves baked each day and the research-and-development priorities. If market forces make the wrong\ndecision, they soon correct themselves, or so capitalists believe. For our current purposes, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter whether the theory is correct. The crucial thing is that the theory understands economics in\nterms of data processing.\nWhere Has All the Power Gone?\nPolitical scientists also increasingly interpret human political structures as data-processing systems.\nLike capitalism and communism, so democracies and dictatorships are in essence competing\nmechanisms for gathering and analysing information. Dictatorships use centralised processing\nmethods, whereas democracies prefer distributed processing. In the last decades democracy gained\nthe upper hand because under the unique conditions of the late twentieth century, distributed\nprocessing worked better. Under alternative conditions \u2013 those prevailing in the ancient Roman\nEmpire, for instance \u2013 centralised processing had an edge, which is why the Roman Republic fell and\npower shifted from the Senate and popular assemblies into the hands of a single autocratic emperor.\nThis implies that as data-processing conditions change again in the twenty-first century, democracy\nmight decline and even disappear. As both the volume and speed of data increase, venerable\ninstitutions like elections, parties and parliaments might become obsolete \u2013 not because they are\nunethical, but because they don\u2019t process data efficiently enough. These institutions evolved in an era\nwhen politics moved faster than technology. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Industrial\nRevolution unfolded slowly enough for politicians and voters to remain one step ahead of it and\nregulate and manipulate its course. Yet whereas the rhythm of politics has not changed much since the\ndays of steam, technology has switched from first gear to fourth. Technological revolutions now\noutpace political processes, causing MPs and voters alike to lose control.\nThe rise of the Internet gives us a taste of things to come. Cyberspace is now crucial to our daily\nlives, our economy and our security. Yet the critical choices between alternative web designs weren\u2019t\ntaken through a democratic political process, even though they involved traditional political issues\nsuch as sovereignty, borders, privacy and security. Did you ever vote about the shape of cyberspace?\nDecisions made by web designers far from the public limelight mean that today the Internet is a free\nand lawless zone that erodes state sovereignty, ignores borders, abolishes privacy and poses perhaps\nthe most formidable global security risk. Whereas a decade ago it hardly registered on the radar,\ntoday hysterical officials are predicting an imminent cyber 9/11.\nGovernments and NGOs consequently conduct intense debates about restructuring the Internet, but\nit is much harder to change an existing system than to intervene at its inception. Besides, by the time\nthe cumbersome government bureaucracy makes up its mind about cyber regulation, the Internet has\nmorphed ten times. The governmental tortoise cannot keep up with the technological hare. It is\noverwhelmed by data. The NSA may be spying on your every word, but to judge by the repeated\nfailures of American foreign policy, nobody in Washington knows what to do with all the data. Never\nin history did a government know so much about what\u2019s going on in the world \u2013 yet few empires have\nbotched things up as clumsily as the contemporary United States. It\u2019s like a poker player who knows\nwhat cards his opponents hold, yet somehow still manages to lose round after round.\nIn the coming decades, it is likely that we will see more Internet-like revolutions, in which\ntechnology steals a march on politics. Artificial intelligence and biotechnology might soon overhaul\nour societies and economies \u2013 and our bodies and minds too \u2013 but they are hardly a blip on our\npolitical radar. Our current democratic structures just cannot collect and process the relevant data fast\nenough, and most voters don\u2019t understand biology and cybernetics well enough to form any pertinent\nopinions. Hence traditional democratic politics loses control of events, and fails to provide us with\nmeaningful visions for the future.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we will go back to twentieth-century-style dictatorships. Authoritarian regimes\nseem to be equally overwhelmed by the pace of technological development and the speed and volume\nof the data flow. In the twentieth century, dictators had grand visions for the future. Communists and\nfascists alike sought to completely destroy the old world and build a new world in its place.\nWhatever you think about Lenin, Hitler or Mao, you cannot accuse them of lacking vision. Today it\nseems that leaders have a chance to pursue even grander visions. While communists and Nazis tried\nto create a new society and a new human with the help of steam engines and typewriters, today\u2019s\nprophets could rely on biotechnology and super-computers.\nIn science-fiction films, ruthless Hitler-like politicians are quick to pounce on such new\ntechnologies, putting them in the service of this or that megalomaniac political ideal. Yet flesh-andblood politicians in the early twenty-first century, even in authoritarian countries such as Russia, Iran\nor North Korea, are nothing like their Hollywood counterparts. They don\u2019t seem to plot any Brave\nNew World. The wildest dreams of Kim Jong-un and Ali Khamenei don\u2019t go much beyond atom\nbombs and ballistic missiles: that is so 1945. Putin\u2019s aspirations seem confined to rebuilding the old\nSoviet zone, or the even older tsarist empire. Meanwhile in the USA, paranoid Republicans accuse\nBarack Obama of being a ruthless despot hatching conspiracies to destroy the foundations of\nAmerican society \u2013 yet in eight years of presidency he barely managed to pass a minor health-care\nreform. Creating new worlds and new humans is far beyond his agenda.\nPrecisely because technology is now moving so fast, and parliaments and dictators alike are\noverwhelmed by data they cannot process quickly enough, present-day politicians are thinking on a\nfar smaller scale than their predecessors a century ago. In the early twenty-first century, politics is\nconsequently bereft of grand visions. Government has become mere administration. It manages the\ncountry, but it no longer leads it. It makes sure teachers are paid on time and sewage systems don\u2019t\noverflow, but it has no idea where the country will be in twenty years.\nTo some extent, this is a very good thing. Given that some of the big political visions of the\ntwentieth century led us to Auschwitz, Hiroshima and the Great Leap Forward, maybe we are better\noff in the hands of petty-minded bureaucrats. Mixing godlike technology with megalomaniac politics\nis a recipe for disaster. Many neo-liberal economists and political scientists argue that it is best to\nleave all the important decisions in the hands of the free market. They thereby give politicians the\nperfect excuse for inaction and ignorance, which are reinterpreted as profound wisdom. Politicians\nfind it convenient to believe that the reason they don\u2019t understand the world is that they need not\nunderstand it.\nYet mixing godlike technology with myopic politics also has its downside. Lack of vision isn\u2019t\nalways a blessing, and not all visions are necessarily bad. In the twentieth century, the dystopian Nazi\nvision did not fall apart spontaneously. It was defeated by the equally grand visions of socialism and\nliberalism. It is dangerous to trust our future to market forces, because these forces do what\u2019s good\nfor the market rather than what\u2019s good for humankind or for the world. The hand of the market is blind\nas well as invisible, and left to its own devices it may fail to do anything about the threat of global\nwarming or the dangerous potential of artificial intelligence.\nSome people believe that there is somebody in charge after all. Not democratic politicians or\nautocratic despots, but rather a small coterie of billionaires who secretly run the world. But such\nconspiracy theories never work, because they underestimate the complexity of the system. A few\nbillionaires smoking cigars and drinking Scotch in some back room cannot possibly understand\neverything happening on the globe, let alone control it. Ruthless billionaires and small interest groups\nflourish in today\u2019s chaotic world not because they read the map better than anyone else, but because\nthey have very narrow aims. In a chaotic system, tunnel vision has its advantages, and the billionaires\u2019\npower is strictly proportional to their goals. If the world\u2019s richest man would like to make another\nbillion dollars he could easily game the system in order to achieve his goal. In contrast, if he would\nlike to reduce global inequality or stop global warming, even he won\u2019t be able to do it, because the\nsystem is far too complex.\nYet power vacuums seldom last long. If in the twenty-first century traditional political structures\ncan no longer process the data fast enough to produce meaningful visions, then new and more efficient\nstructures will evolve to take their place. These new structures may be very different from any\nprevious political institutions, whether democratic or authoritarian. The only question is who will\nbuild and control these structures. If humankind is no longer up to the task, perhaps it might give\nsomebody else a try.\nHistory in a Nutshell\nFrom a Dataist perspective, we may interpret the entire human species as a single data-processing\nsystem, with individual humans serving as its chips. If so, we can also understand the whole of\nhistory as a process of improving the efficiency of this system, through four basic methods:\n1. Increasing the number of processors. A city of 100,000 people has more computing power than\na village of 1,000 people.\n2. Increasing the variety of processors. Different processors may use diverse ways to calculate\nand analyse data. Using several kinds of processors in a single system may therefore increase its\ndynamism and creativity. A conversation between a peasant, a priest and a physician may produce\nnovel ideas that would never emerge from a conversation between three hunter-gatherers.\n3. Increasing the number of connections between processors. There is little point in increasing the\nmere number and variety of processors if they are poorly connected to each other. A trade network\nlinking ten cities is likely to result in many more economic, technological and social innovations\nthan ten isolated cities.\n4. Increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. Connecting processors is\nhardly useful if data cannot flow freely. Just building roads between ten cities won\u2019t be very useful\nif they are plagued by robbers, or if some autocratic despot doesn\u2019t allow merchants and travellers\nto move as they wish.\nThese four methods often contradict one another. The greater the number and variety of processors,\nthe harder it is to freely connect them. The construction of the Sapiens data-processing system\naccordingly passed through four main stages, each characterised by an emphasis on different methods.\nThe first stage began with the Cognitive Revolution, which made it possible to connect unlimited\nnumbers of Sapiens into a single data-processing network. This gave Sapiens a crucial advantage\nover all other human and animal species. While there is a strict limit to the number of Neanderthals,\nchimpanzees or elephants you can connect to the same net, there is no limit to the number of Sapiens.\nSapiens used their advantage in data processing to overrun the entire world. However, as they\nspread into different lands and climates they lost touch with one another, and underwent diverse\ncultural transformations. The result was an immense variety of human cultures, each with its own\nlifestyle, behaviour patterns and world view. Hence the first phase of history involved an increase in\nthe number and variety of human processors, at the expense of connectivity: 20,000 years ago there\nwere many more Sapiens than 70,000 years ago, and Sapiens in Europe processed information\ndifferently to Sapiens in China. However, there were no connections between people in Europe and\nChina, and it would have seemed utterly impossible that all Sapiens may one day be part of a single\ndata-processing web.\nThe second stage began with the Agricultural Revolution and continued until the invention of\nwriting and money about 5,000 years ago. Agriculture speeded demographic growth, so the number of\nhuman processors rose sharply. Simultaneously, agriculture enabled many more people to live\ntogether in the same place, thereby generating dense local networks that contained an unprecedented\nnumber of processors. In addition, agriculture created new incentives and opportunities for different\nnetworks to trade and communicate with one another. Nevertheless, during the second phase\ncentrifugal forces remained predominant. In the absence of writing and money, humans could not\nestablish cities, kingdoms or empires. Humankind was still divided into innumerable little tribes,\neach with its own lifestyle and world view. Uniting the whole of humankind was not even a fantasy.\nThe third stage kicked off with the invention of writing and money about 5,000 years ago, and\nlasted until the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Thanks to writing and money, the gravitational\nfield of human cooperation finally overpowered the centrifugal forces. Human groups bonded and\nmerged to form cities and kingdoms. Political and commercial links between different cities and\nkingdoms also tightened. At least since the first millennium BC \u2013 when coinage, empires and universal\nreligions appeared \u2013 humans began to consciously dream about forging a single network that would\nencompass the entire globe.\nThis dream became a reality during the fourth and last stage of history, which began around 1492.\nEarly modern explorers, conquerors and traders wove the first thin threads that encompassed the\nwhole world. In the late modern period these threads were made stronger and denser, so that the\nspider\u2019s web of Columbus\u2019s days became the steel and asphalt grid of the twenty-first century. Even\nmore importantly, information was allowed to flow increasingly freely along this global grid. When\nColumbus first hooked up the Eurasian net to the American net, only a few bits of data could cross the\nocean each year, running the gauntlet of cultural prejudices, strict censorship and political repression.\nBut as the years went by, the free market, the scientific community, the rule of law and the spread of\ndemocracy all helped to lift the barriers. We often imagine that democracy and the free market won\nbecause they were \u2018good\u2019. In truth, they won because they improved the global data-processing\nsystem.\nSo over the last 70,000 years humankind first spread out, then separated into distinct groups, and\nfinally merged again. Yet the process of unification did not take us back to the beginning. When the\ndifferent human groups fused into the global village of today, each brought along its unique legacy of\nthoughts, tools and behaviours, which it collected and developed along the way. Our modern larders\nare now stuffed with Middle Eastern wheat, Andean potatoes, New Guinean sugar and Ethiopian\ncoffee. Similarly, our language, religion, music and politics are replete with heirlooms from across\nthe planet.\n5\nIf humankind is indeed a single data-processing system, what is its output? Dataists would say that\nits output will be the creation of a new and even more efficient data-processing system, called the\nInternet-of-All-Things. Once this mission is accomplished, Homo sapiens will vanish.\nInformation Wants to be Free\nLike capitalism, Dataism too began as a neutral scientific theory, but is now mutating into a religion\nthat claims to determine right and wrong. The supreme value of this new religion is \u2018information\nflow\u2019. If life is the movement of information, and if we think that life is good, it follows that we\nshould extend, deepen and spread the flow of information in the universe. According to Dataism,\nhuman experiences are not sacred and Homo sapiens isn\u2019t the apex of creation or a precursor of some\nfuture Homo deus. Humans are merely tools for creating the Internet-of-All-Things, which may\neventually spread out from planet Earth to cover the whole galaxy and even the whole universe. This\ncosmic data-processing system would be like God. It will be everywhere and will control everything,\nand humans are destined to merge into it.\nThis vision is reminiscent of some traditional religious visions. Thus Hindus believe that humans\ncan and should merge into the universal soul of the cosmos \u2013 the atman. Christians believe that after\ndeath saints are filled by the infinite grace of God, whereas sinners cut themselves off from His\npresence. Indeed, in Silicon Valley the Dataist prophets consciously use traditional messianic\nlanguage. For example, Ray Kurzweil\u2019s book of prophecies is called The Singularity is Near,\nechoing John the Baptist\u2019s cry: \u2018the kingdom of heaven is near\u2019 (Matthew 3:2).\nDataists explain to those who still worship flesh-and-blood mortals that they are overly attached to\noutdated technology. Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm. After all, what\u2019s the advantage of\nhumans over chickens? Only that in humans information flows in much more complex patterns than in\nchickens. Humans absorb more data, and process it using better algorithms. (In day-to-day language\nthat means that humans allegedly have deeper emotions and superior intellectual abilities. But\nremember that according to current biological dogma, emotions and intelligence are just algorithms.)\nWell then, if we could create a data-processing system that absorbs even more data than a human\nbeing, and that processes it even more efficiently, wouldn\u2019t that system be superior to a human in\nexactly the same way that a human is superior to a chicken?\nDataism isn\u2019t limited to idle prophecies. Like every religion, it has its practical commandments.\nFirst and foremost, a Dataist ought to maximise data flow by connecting to more and more media, and\nproducing and consuming more and more information. Like other successful religions, Dataism is also\nmissionary. Its second commandment is to connect everything to the system, including heretics who\ndon\u2019t want to be connected. And \u2018everything\u2019 means more than just humans. It means every thing. My\nbody, of course, but also the cars on the street, the refrigerators in the kitchen, the chickens in their\ncoop and the trees in the jungle \u2013 all should be connected to the Internet-of-All-Things. The\nrefrigerator will monitor the number of eggs in the drawer, and inform the chicken coop when a new\nshipment is needed. The cars will talk with one another, and the trees in the jungle will report on the\nweather and on carbon dioxide levels. We mustn\u2019t leave any part of the universe disconnected from\nthe great web of life. Conversely, the greatest sin is to block the data flow. What is death, if not a\nsituation when information doesn\u2019t flow? Hence Dataism upholds the freedom of information as the\ngreatest good of all.\nPeople rarely manage to come up with a completely new value. The last time this happened was in\nthe eighteenth century, when the humanist revolution preached the stirring ideals of human liberty,\nhuman equality and human fraternity. Since 1789, despite numerous wars, revolutions and upheavals,\nhumans have not managed to come up with any new value. All subsequent conflicts and struggles have\nbeen conducted either in the name of the three humanist values, or in the name of even older values\nsuch as obeying God or serving the nation. Dataism is the first movement since 1789 that created a\nreally novel value: freedom of information.\nWe mustn\u2019t confuse freedom of information with the old liberal ideal of freedom of expression.\nFreedom of expression was given to humans, and protected their right to think and say what they\nwished \u2013 including their right to keep their mouths shut and their thoughts to themselves. Freedom of\ninformation, in contrast, is not given to humans. It is given to information. Moreover, this novel value\nmay impinge on the traditional freedom of expression, by privileging the right of information to\ncirculate freely over the right of humans to own data and to restrict its movement.\nOn 11 January 2013, Dataism got its first martyr when Aaron Swartz, a twenty-six-year-old\nAmerican hacker, committed suicide in his apartment. Swartz was a rare genius. At fourteen, he\nhelped develop the crucial RSS protocol. Swartz was also a firm believer in the freedom of\ninformation. In 2008 he published the \u2018Guerilla Open Access Manifesto\u2019 that demanded a free and\nunlimited flow of information. Swartz said that \u2018We need to take information, wherever it is stored,\nmake our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that\u2019s out of copyright and add\nit to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download\nscientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open\nAccess.\u2019\nSwartz was as good as his word. He became annoyed with the JSTOR digital library for charging\nits customers. JSTOR holds millions of scientific papers and studies, and believes in the freedom of\nexpression of scientists and journal editors, which includes the freedom to charge a fee for reading\ntheir articles. According to JSTOR, if I want to get paid for the ideas I created, it\u2019s my right to do so.\nSwartz thought otherwise. He believed that information wants to be free, that ideas don\u2019t belong to the\npeople who created them, and that it is wrong to lock data behind walls and charge money for\nentrance. He used the MIT computer network to access JSTOR, and downloaded hundreds of\nthousands of scientific papers, which he intended to release onto the Internet, so that everybody could\nread them freely.\nSwartz was arrested and put on trial. When he realised he would probably be convicted and sent to\njail, he hanged himself. Hackers reacted with petitions and attacks directed at the academic and\ngovernmental institutions that persecuted Swartz and that infringe on the freedom of information.\nUnder pressure, JSTOR apologised for its part in the tragedy, and today allows free access to much of\nits data (though not to all of it).\n6\nTo convince sceptics, Dataist missionaries repeatedly explain the immense benefits of the freedom of\ninformation. Just as capitalists believe that all good things depend on economic growth, so Dataists\nbelieve all good things \u2013 including economic growth \u2013 depend on the freedom of information. Why\ndid the USA grow faster than the USSR? Because information flowed more freely in the USA. Why\nare Americans healthier, wealthier and happier than Iranians or Nigerians? Thanks to the freedom of\ninformation. So if we want to create a better world, the key is to set the data free.\nWe have already seen that Google can detect new epidemics faster than traditional health\norganisations, but only if we allow it free access to the information we are producing. A free data\nflow can similarly reduce pollution and waste, for example by rationalising the transportation system.\nIn 2010 the number of private cars in the world exceeded 1 billion, and it has since kept growing.\n7\nThese cars pollute the planet and waste enormous resources, not least by necessitating ever wider\nroads and parking spaces. People have become so used to the convenience of private transport that\nthey are unlikely to settle for buses and trains. However, Dataists point out that people really want\nmobility rather than a private car, and a good data-processing system can provide this mobility far\nmore cheaply and efficiently.\nI have a private car, but most of the time it sits idly in the car park. On a typical day, I enter my car\nat 8:04, and drive for half an hour to the university, where I park my car for the day. At 18:11 I come\nback to the car, drive half an hour back home, and that\u2019s it. So I am using my car for just an hour a day.\nWhy do I need to keep it for the other twenty-three hours? We can create a smart car-pool system, run\nby computer algorithms. The computer would know that I need to leave home at 8:04, and would\nroute the nearest autonomous car to pick me up at that precise moment. After dropping me off at\ncampus, it would be available for other uses instead of waiting in the car park. At 18:11 sharp, as I\nleave the university gate, another communal car would stop right in front of me, and take me home. In\nsuch a way, 50 million communal autonomous cars may replace 1 billion private cars, and we would\nalso need far fewer roads, bridges, tunnels and parking spaces. Provided, of course, I renounce my\nprivacy and allow the algorithms to always know where I am and where I want to go.\nRecord, Upload, Share!\nBut maybe you don\u2019t need convincing, especially if you are under twenty. People just want to be part\nof the data flow, even if that means giving up their privacy, their autonomy and their individuality.\nHumanist art sanctifies the individual genius, and a Picasso doodle on a napkin nets millions at\nSotheby\u2019s. Humanist science glorifies the individual researcher, and every scholar dreams of putting\nhis or her name at the top of a Science or Nature paper. But a growing number of artistic and\nscientific creations are nowadays produced by the ceaseless collaboration of \u2018everyone\u2019. Who writes\nWikipedia? All of us.\nThe individual is becoming a tiny chip inside a giant system that nobody really understands. Every\nday I absorb countless data bits through emails, phone calls and articles; process the data; and\ntransmit back new bits through more emails, phone calls and articles. I don\u2019t really know where I fit\ninto the great scheme of things, and how my bits of data connect with the bits produced by billions of\nother humans and computers. I don\u2019t have time to find out, because I am too busy answering all the\nemails. And as I process more data more efficiently \u2013 answering more emails, making more phone\ncalls and writing more articles \u2013 so the people around me are flooded by even more data.\nThis relentless flow of data sparks new inventions and disruptions that nobody plans, controls or\ncomprehends. No one understands how the global economy functions or where global politics is\nheading. But no one needs to understand. All you need to do is answer your emails faster \u2013 and allow\nthe system to read them. Just as free-market capitalists believe in the invisible hand of the market, so\nDataists believe in the invisible hand of the data flow.\nAs the global data-processing system becomes all-knowing and all-powerful, so connecting to the\nsystem becomes the source of all meaning. Humans want to merge into the data flow because when\nyou are part of the data flow you are part of something much bigger than yourself. Traditional\nreligions told you that your every word and action was part of some great cosmic plan, and that God\nwatched you every minute and cared about all your thoughts and feelings. Data religion now says that\nyour every word and action is part of the great data flow, that the algorithms are constantly watching\nyou and that they care about everything you do and feel. Most people like this very much. For truebelievers, to be disconnected from the data flow risks losing the very meaning of life. What\u2019s the\npoint of doing or experiencing anything if nobody knows about it, and if it doesn\u2019t contribute\nsomething to the global exchange of information?\nHumanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the\nmeaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that\nexperiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not \u2013 indeed cannot \u2013 find meaning\nwithin ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the\nalgorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do. Twenty years ago Japanese tourists were\na universal laughing stock because they always carried cameras and took pictures of everything in\nsight. Now everyone is doing it. If you go to India and see an elephant, you don\u2019t look at the elephant\nand ask yourself, \u2018What do I feel?\u2019 \u2013 you are too busy looking for your smartphone, taking a picture of\nthe elephant, posting it on Facebook and then checking your account every two minutes to see how\nmany Likes you got. Writing a private diary \u2013 a common humanist practice in previous generations \u2013\nsounds to many present-day youngsters utterly pointless. Why write anything if nobody else can read\nit? The new motto says: \u2018If you experience something \u2013 record it. If you record something \u2013 upload it.\nIf you upload something \u2013 share it.\u2019\nThroughout this book we have repeatedly asked what makes humans superior to other animals.\nDataism has a new and simple answer. In themselves, human experiences are not superior at all to the\nexperiences of wolves or elephants. One bit of data is as good as another. However, a human can\nwrite a poem about his experience and post it online, thereby enriching the global data-processing\nsystem. That makes his bits count. A wolf cannot do this. Hence all of the wolf\u2019s experiences \u2013 as\ndeep and complex as they may be \u2013 are worthless. No wonder we are so busy converting our\nexperiences into data. It isn\u2019t a question of trendiness. It is a question of survival. We must prove to\nourselves and to the system that we still have value. And value lies not in having experiences, but in\nturning these experiences into free-flowing data.\n(By the way, wolves \u2013 or at least their dog cousins \u2013 aren\u2019t a hopeless case. A company called \u2018No\nMore Woof\u2019 is developing a helmet for reading canine experiences. The helmet monitors the dog\u2019s\nbrain waves, and uses computer algorithms to translate simple messages such as \u2018I am angry\u2019 into\nhuman language.\n8 Your dog may soon have a Facebook or Twitter account of his own \u2013 perhaps with\nmore Likes and followers than you.)\nKnow Thyself\nDataism is neither liberal nor humanist. It should be emphasised, however, that Dataism isn\u2019t antihumanist. It has nothing against human experiences. It just doesn\u2019t think they are intrinsically valuable.\nWhen we surveyed the three main humanist sects, we asked which experience is the most valuable:\nlistening to Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony, to Chuck Berry, to a pygmy initiation song or to the howl of\na wolf in heat. A Dataist would argue that the entire exercise is misguided, because music should be\nevaluated according to the data it carries rather than according to the experience it creates. A Dataist\nmay argue, for example, that the Fifth Symphony carries far more data than the pygmy initiation song,\nbecause it uses more chords and scales, and creates dialogues with many more musical styles.\nConsequently, you need far more computational power to decipher the Fifth Symphony, and you gain\nfar more knowledge from doing so.\nMusic, according to this view, is mathematical patterns. Mathematics can describe every musical\npiece, as well as the relations between any two pieces. Hence you can measure the precise data value\nof every symphony, song and howl, and determine which is the richest. The experiences they create in\nhumans or wolves don\u2019t really matter. True, for the last 70,000 years or so, human experiences have\nbeen the most efficient data-processing algorithms in the universe, hence there was good reason to\nsanctify them. However, we may soon reach a point when these algorithms will be superseded, and\neven become a burden.\nSapiens evolved in the African savannah tens of thousands of years ago, and their algorithms are\njust not built to handle twenty-first-century data flows. We might try to upgrade the human dataprocessing system, but this may not be enough. The Internet-of-All-Things may soon create such huge\nand rapid data flows that even upgraded human algorithms cannot handle it. When the car replaced the\nhorse-drawn carriage, we didn\u2019t upgrade the horses \u2013 we retired them. Perhaps it is time to do the\nsame with Homo sapiens.\nDataism adopts a strictly functional approach to humanity, appraising the value of human\nexperiences according to their function in data-processing mechanisms. If we develop an algorithm\nthat fulfils the same function better, human experiences will lose their value. Thus if we can replace\nnot just taxi drivers and doctors but also lawyers, poets and musicians with superior computer\nprograms, why should we care if these programs have no consciousness and no subjective\nexperiences? If some humanist starts adulating the sacredness of human experience, Dataists would\ndismiss such sentimental humbug. \u2018The experience you praise is just an outdated biochemical\nalgorithm. In the African savannah 70,000 years ago, that algorithm was state-of-the-art. Even in the\ntwentieth century it was vital for the army and for the economy. But soon we will have much better\nalgorithms.\u2019\nIn the climactic scene of many Hollywood science-fiction movies, humans face an alien invasion\nfleet, an army of rebellious robots or an all-knowing super-computer that wants to obliterate them.\nHumanity seems doomed. But at the very last moment, against all the odds, humanity triumphs thanks\nto something that the aliens, the robots and the super-computers didn\u2019t suspect and cannot fathom:\nlove. The hero, who up till now has been easily manipulated by the super-computer and has been\nriddled with bullets by the evil robots, is inspired by his sweetheart to make a completely unexpected\nmove that turns the tables on the thunderstruck Matrix. Dataism finds such scenarios utterly ridiculous.\n\u2018Come on,\u2019 it admonishes the Hollywood screenwriters, \u2018is that all you could come up with? Love?\nAnd not even some platonic cosmic love, but the carnal attraction between two mammals? Do you\nreally think that an all-knowing super-computer or aliens who managed to conquer the entire galaxy\nwould be dumbfounded by a hormonal rush?\u2019\nBy equating the human experience with data patterns, Dataism undermines our main source of\nauthority and meaning, and heralds a tremendous religious revolution, the like of which has not been\nseen since the eighteenth century. In the days of Locke, Hume and Voltaire humanists argued that \u2018God\nis a product of the human imagination\u2019. Dataism now gives humanists a taste of their own medicine,\nand tells them: \u2018Yes, God is a product of the human imagination, but human imagination in turn is the\nproduct of biochemical algorithms.\u2019 In the eighteenth century, humanism sidelined God by shifting\nfrom a deo-centric to a homo-centric world view. In the twenty-first century, Dataism may sideline\nhumans by shifting from a homo-centric to a data-centric view.\nThe Dataist revolution will probably take a few decades, if not a century or two. But then the\nhumanist revolution too did not happen overnight. At first, humans kept on believing in God, and\nargued that humans are sacred because they were created by God for some divine purpose. Only much\nlater did some people dare say that humans are sacred in their own right, and that God doesn\u2019t exist at\nall. Similarly, today most Dataists say that the Internet-of-All-Things is sacred because humans are\ncreating it to serve human needs. But eventually, the Internet-of-All-Things may become sacred in its\nown right.\nThe shift from a homo-centric to a data-centric world view won\u2019t be merely a philosophical\nrevolution. It will be a practical revolution. All truly important revolutions are practical. The\nhumanist idea that \u2018humans invented God\u2019 was significant because it had far-reaching practical\nimplications. Similarly, the Dataist idea that \u2018organisms are algorithms\u2019 is significant due to its dayto-day practical consequences. Ideas change the world only when they change our behaviour.\nIn ancient Babylon, when people faced a difficult dilemma they climbed to the top of the local\ntemple in the darkness of night and observed the sky. The Babylonians believed that the stars control\nour fate and predict our future. By watching the stars the Babylonians decided whether to get married,\nplough the field and go to war. Their philosophical beliefs were translated into very practical\nprocedures.\nScriptural religions such as Judaism and Christianity told a different story: \u2018The stars are lying.\nGod, who created the stars, revealed the entire truth in the Bible. So stop observing the stars \u2013 read\nthe Bible instead!\u2019 This too was a practical recommendation. When people didn\u2019t know whom to\nmarry, what career to choose and whether to start a war, they read the Bible and followed its counsel.\nNext came the humanists, with an altogether new story: \u2018Humans invented God, wrote the Bible\nand then interpreted it in a thousand different ways. So humans themselves are the source of all truth.\nYou may read the Bible as an inspiring human creation, but you don\u2019t have to. If you are facing any\ndilemma, just listen to yourself and follow your inner voice.\u2019 Humanism then gave detailed practical\ninstructions on how to listen to yourself, recommending things such as watching sunsets, reading\nGoethe, keeping a private diary, having heart-to-heart talks with a good friend and holding democratic\nelections.\nFor centuries scientists too accepted these humanist guidelines. When physicists wondered whether\nto get married or not, they too watched sunsets and tried to get in touch with themselves. When\nchemists contemplated whether to accept a problematic job offer, they too wrote diaries and had\nheart-to-heart talks with a good friend. When biologists debated whether to wage war or sign a peace\ntreaty, they too voted in democratic elections. When brain scientists wrote books about their startling\ndiscoveries, they often put an inspiring Goethe quote on the first page. This was the basis for the\nmodern alliance between science and humanism, which kept the delicate balance between the modern\nyang and the modern yin \u2013 between reason and emotion, between the laboratory and the museum,\nbetween the production line and the supermarket.\nThe scientists not only sanctified human feelings, but also found an excellent evolutionary reason to\ndo so. After Darwin, biologists began explaining that feelings are complex algorithms honed by\nevolution to help animals make the right decisions. Our love, our fear and our passion aren\u2019t some\nnebulous spiritual phenomena good only for composing poetry. Rather, they encapsulate millions of\nyears of practical wisdom. When you read the Bible, you get advice from a few priests and rabbis\nwho lived in ancient Jerusalem. In contrast, when you listen to your feelings, you follow an algorithm\nthat evolution has developed for millions of years, and that withstood the harshest quality tests of\nnatural selection. Your feelings are the voice of millions of ancestors, each of whom managed to\nsurvive and reproduce in an unforgiving environment. Your feelings are not infallible, of course, but\nthey are better than most alternatives. For millions upon millions of years, feelings were the best\nalgorithms in the world. Hence in the days of Confucius, of Muhammad or of Stalin, people should\nhave listened to their feelings rather than to the teachings of Confucianism, Islam or communism.\nYet in the twenty-first century, feelings are no longer the best algorithms in the world. We are\ndeveloping superior algorithms which utilise unprecedented computing power and giant databases.\nThe Google and Facebook algorithms not only know exactly how you feel, they also know a million\nother things about you that you hardly suspect. Consequently you should now stop listening to your\nfeelings, and start listening to these external algorithms instead. What\u2019s the use of having democratic\nelections when the algorithms know how each person is going to vote, and when they also know the\nexact neurological reasons why one person votes Democrat while another votes Republican?\nWhereas humanism commanded: \u2018Listen to your feelings!\u2019 Dataism now commands: \u2018Listen to the\nalgorithms! They know how you feel.\u2019\nWhen you contemplate whom to marry, which career to pursue and whether to start a war, Dataism\ntells you it would be a total waste of time to climb a high mountain and watch the sun setting on the\nwaves. It would be equally pointless to go to a museum, write a private diary or have a heart-to-heart\ntalk with a friend. Yes, in order to make the right decisions you must get to know yourself better. But\nif you want to know yourself in the twenty-first century, there are much better methods than climbing\nmountains, going to museums or writing diaries. Here are some practical Dataist guidelines for you:\n\u2018You want to know who you really are?\u2019 asks Dataism. \u2018Then forget about mountains and museums.\nHave you had your DNA sequenced? No?! What are you waiting for? Go and do it today. And\nconvince your grandparents, parents and siblings to have their DNA sequenced too \u2013 their data is very\nvaluable for you. And have you heard about these wearable biometric devices that measure your\nblood pressure and heart rate twenty-four hours a day? Good \u2013 so buy one of those, put it on and\nconnect it to your smartphone. And while you are shopping, buy a mobile camera and microphone,\nrecord everything you do, and put in online. And allow Google and Facebook to read all your emails,\nmonitor all your chats and messages, and keep a record of all your Likes and clicks. If you do all that,\nthen the great algorithms of the Internet-of-All-Things will tell you whom to marry, which career to\npursue and whether to start a war.\u2019\nBut where do these great algorithms come from? This is the mystery of Dataism. Just as according\nto Christianity we humans cannot understand God and His plan, so Dataism says the human brain\ncannot embrace the new master algorithms. At present, of course, the algorithms are mostly written by\nhuman hackers. Yet the really important algorithms \u2013 such as the Google search algorithm \u2013 are\ndeveloped by huge teams. Each member understands just one part of the puzzle, and nobody really\nunderstands the algorithm as a whole. Moreover, with the rise of machine learning and artificial\nneural networks, more and more algorithms evolve independently, improving themselves and learning\nfrom their own mistakes. They analyse astronomical amounts of data, which no human can possibly\nencompass, and learn to recognise patterns and adopt strategies that escape the human mind. The seed\nalgorithm may initially be developed by humans, but as it grows, it follows its own path, going where\nno human has gone before \u2013 and where no human can follow.\nARipple in the Data Flow\nDataism naturally has its critics and heretics. As we saw in Chapter 3, it\u2019s doubtful whether life can\nreally be reduced to data flows. In particular, at present we have no idea how or why data flows\ncould produce consciousness and subjective experiences. Maybe we\u2019ll have a good explanation in\ntwenty years. But maybe we\u2019ll discover that organisms aren\u2019t algorithms after all.\nIt is equally doubtful whether life boils down to decision-making. Under Dataist influence, both the\nlife sciences and the social sciences have become obsessed with decision-making processes, as if\nthat\u2019s all there is to life. But is it so? Sensations, emotions and thoughts certainly play an important\npart in making decisions, but is that their sole meaning? Dataism gains a better and better\nunderstanding of decision-making processes, but it might be adopting an increasingly skewed view of\nlife.\nA critical examination of the Dataist dogma is likely to be not only the greatest scientific challenge\nof the twenty-first century, but also the most urgent political and economic project. Scholars in the life\nsciences and social sciences should ask themselves whether we miss anything when we understand\nlife as data processing and decision-making. Is there perhaps something in the universe that cannot be\nreduced to data? Suppose non-conscious algorithms could eventually outperform conscious\nintelligence in all known data-processing tasks \u2013 what, if anything, would be lost by replacing\nconscious intelligence with superior non-conscious algorithms?\nOf course, even if Dataism is wrong and organisms aren\u2019t just algorithms, it won\u2019t necessarily\nprevent Dataism from taking over the world. Many previous religions gained enormous popularity\nand power despite their factual mistakes. If Christianity and communism could do it, why not\nDataism? Dataism has especially good prospects, because it is currently spreading across all\nscientific disciplines. A unified scientific paradigm may easily become an unassailable dogma. It is\nvery difficult to contest a scientific paradigm, but up till now, no single paradigm was adopted by the\nentire scientific establishment. Hence scholars in one field could always import heretical views from\noutside. But if everyone from musicologists to biologists uses the same Dataist paradigm,\ninterdisciplinary excursions will serve only to strengthen the paradigm further. Consequently even if\nthe paradigm is flawed, it would be extremely difficult to resist it.\nIf Dataism succeeds in conquering the world, what will happen to us humans? In the beginning, it\nwill probably accelerate the humanist pursuit of health, happiness and power. Dataism spreads itself\nby promising to fulfil these humanist aspirations. In order to gain immortality, bliss and divine\npowers of creation, we need to process immense amounts of data, far beyond the capacity of the\nhuman brain. So the algorithms will do it for us. Yet once authority shifts from humans to algorithms,\nthe humanist projects may become irrelevant. Once we abandon the homo-centric world view in\nfavour of a data-centric world view, human health and happiness may seem far less important. Why\nbother so much about obsolete data-processing machines when much better models are already in\nexistence? We are striving to engineer the Internet-of-All-Things in the hope that it will make us\nhealthy, happy and powerful. Yet once the Internet-of-All-Things is up and running, we might be\nreduced from engineers to chips, then to data, and eventually we might dissolve within the data torrent\nlike a clump of earth within a gushing river.\nDataism thereby threatens to do to Homo sapiens what Homo sapiens has done to all other\nanimals. In the course of history humans have created a global network, and evaluated everything\naccording to its function within the network. For thousands of years, this boosted human pride and\nprejudices. Since humans fulfilled the most important functions in the network, it was easy for us to\ntake credit for the network\u2019s achievements, and to see ourselves as the apex of creation. The lives and\nexperiences of all other animals were undervalued, because they fulfilled far less important functions,\nand whenever an animal ceased to fulfil any function at all, it went extinct. However, once humans\nlose their functional importance to the network, we will discover that we are not the apex of creation\nafter all. The yardsticks that we ourselves have enshrined will condemn us to join the mammoths and\nthe Chinese river dolphins in oblivion. Looking back, humanity will turn out to be just a ripple within\nthe cosmic data flow.\nWe cannot really predict the future. All the scenarios outlined in this book should be understood as\npossibilities rather than prophecies. When we think about the future, our horizons are usually\nconstrained by present-day ideologies and social systems. Democracy encourages us to believe in a\ndemocratic future; capitalism doesn\u2019t allow us to envisage a non-capitalist alternative; and humanism\nmakes it difficult for us to imagine a post-human destiny. At most, we sometimes recycle past events\nand think about them as alternative futures. For example, twentieth-century Nazism and communism\nserve as a blueprint for many dystopian fantasies; and science-fiction authors use medieval and\nancient legacies to imagine Jedi knights and galactic emperors fighting it out with spaceships and\nlaser guns.\nThis book traces the origins of our present-day conditioning in order to loosen its grip and enable\nus to think in far more imaginative ways about our future. Instead of narrowing our horizons by\nforecasting a single definitive scenario, the book aims to broaden our horizons and make us aware of\na much wider spectrum of options. As I have repeatedly emphasised, nobody really knows what the\njob market, the family or the ecology will look like in 2050, or what religions, economic systems or\npolitical structures will dominate the world.\nYet broadening our horizons can backfire by making us more confused and inactive than before.\nWith so many scenarios and possibilities, what should we pay attention to? The world is changing\nfaster than ever before, and we are flooded by impossible amounts of data, of ideas, of promises and\nof threats. Humans relinquish authority to the free market, to crowd wisdom and to external\nalgorithms partly because they cannot deal with the deluge of data. In the past, censorship worked by\nblocking the flow of information. In the twenty-first century, censorship works by flooding people\nwith irrelevant information. People just don\u2019t know what to pay attention to, and they often spend\ntheir time investigating and debating side issues. In ancient times having power meant having access\nto data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore. So of everything that happens in our\nchaotic world, what should we focus on?\nIf we think in term of months, we had probably focus on immediate problems such as the turmoil in\nthe Middle East, the refugee crisis in Europe and the slowing of the Chinese economy. If we think in\nterms of decades, then global warming, growing inequality and the disruption of the job market loom\nlarge. Yet if we take the really grand view of life, all other problems and developments are\novershadowed by three interlinked processes:\n1. Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms,\nand life is data processing.\n2. Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.\n3. Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves.\nThese three processes raise three key questions, which I hope will stick in your mind long after you\nhave finished this book:\n1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?\n2. What\u2019s more valuable \u2013 intelligence or consciousness?\n3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent\nalgorithms know us better than we know ourselves?\nNotes\n1 The New Human Agenda\n1.

There will always be some true statements that cannot be proven within the system. In popular literature this theorem is\nsometimes hijacked to account for the existence of mind. Allegedly, minds are needed to deal with such unprovable truths. However,\nit is far from obvious why living beings need to engage with such arcane mathematical truths in order to survive and reproduce. In\nfact, the vast majority of our conscious decisions do not involve such issues at all.\n6.

At least according to medieval scholastics, you\ncannot understand the Bible without logic. If your logic value is zero, then even if you read every page of the Bible, the sum of your\nknowledge would still be zero. Conversely, if your scripture value is zero, then no amount of logic can help you. If the formula used the\naddition symbol, the implication would be that somebody with lots of logic and no scriptures would still have a lot of knowledge \u2013 which\nyou and I may find reasonable, but medievalscholastics did not.\n* In American politics, liberalism is often interpreted far more narrowly, and contrasted with \u2018conservatism\u2019. In the broad sense of the\nterm, however, most American conservatives are also liberal."}]
